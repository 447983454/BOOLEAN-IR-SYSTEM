Paris. The KING's palace.
LAFEU
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
BERTRAM
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
LAFEU
You have it from his own deliverance.
BERTRAM
And by other warranted testimony.
LAFEU
Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.
BERTRAM
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great inknowledge and accordingly valiant.
LAFEU
I have then sinned against his experience andtransgressed against his valour; and my state thatway is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in myheart to repent.
Here he comes: I pray you, makeus friends; I will pursue the amity.
PAROLLES
[To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
LAFEU
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
PAROLLES
Sir?
LAFEU
O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a goodworkman, a very good tailor.
BERTRAM
[Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the king?
PAROLLES
She is.
BERTRAM
Will she away to-night?
PAROLLES
As you'll have her.
BERTRAM
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,Given order for our horses; and to-night,When I should take possession of the bride,End ere I do begin.
LAFEU
A good traveller is something at the latter end of adinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses aknown truth to pass a thousand nothings with, shouldbe once heard and thrice beaten.
God save you, captain.BERTRAM
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
PAROLLES
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord'sdispleasure.
LAFEU
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spursand all, like him that leaped into the custard; andout of it you'll run again, rather than sufferquestion for your residence.
BERTRAM
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
LAFEU
And shall do so ever, though I took him at 'sprayers.
Fare you well, my lord; and believe thisof me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; thesoul of this man is his clothes.
Trust him not inmatter of heavy consequence; I have kept of themtame, and know their natures.
Farewell, monsieur:I have spoken better of you than you have or will todeserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.
PAROLLES
An idle lord.
I swear.BERTRAM
I think so.
PAROLLES
Why, do you not know him?
BERTRAM
Yes, I do know him well, and common speechGives him a worthy pass.
Here comes my clog.HELENA
I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,Spoke with the king and have procured his leaveFor present parting; only he desiresSome private speech with you.
BERTRAM
I shall obey his will.
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,Which holds not colour with the time, nor doesThe ministration and required officeOn my particular.
Prepared I was notFor such a business; therefore am I foundSo much unsettled: this drives me to entreat youThat presently you take our way for home;And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,For my respects are better than they seemAnd my appointments have in them a needGreater than shows itself at the first viewTo you that know them not.
This to my mother:'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, soI leave you to your wisdom.
HELENA
Sir, I can nothing say,But that I am your most obedient servant.
BERTRAM
Come, come, no more of that.
HELENA
And ever shallWith true observance seek to eke out thatWherein toward me my homely stars have fail'dTo equal my great fortune.
BERTRAM
Let that go:My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.
HELENA
Pray, sir, your pardon.
BERTRAM
Well, what would you say?
HELENA
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;But, like a timorous thief, most fain would stealWhat law does vouch mine own.
BERTRAM
What would you have?
HELENA
Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
I would not tell you what I would, my lord:Faith yes;Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.
BERTRAM
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
HELENA
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
BERTRAM
Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.
Go thou toward home; where I will never comeWhilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
Away, and for our flight.
PAROLLES
Bravely, coragio!
