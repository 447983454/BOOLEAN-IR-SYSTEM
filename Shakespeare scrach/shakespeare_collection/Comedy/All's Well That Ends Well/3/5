Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.
Widow
Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, weshall lose all the sight.
DIANA
They say the French count has done most honourable service.
Widow
It is reported that he has taken their greatestcommander; and that with his own hand he slew theduke's brother.
We have lost our labour; they are gone a contraryway: hark! you may know by their trumpets.
MARIANA
Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves withthe report of it.
Well, Diana, take heed of thisFrench earl: the honour of a maid is her name; andno legacy is so rich as honesty.
Widow
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicitedby a gentleman his companion.
MARIANA
I know that knave; hang him!
one Parolles: afilthy officer he is in those suggestions for theyoung earl.
Beware of them, Diana; their promises,enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines oflust, are not the things they go under: many a maidhath been seduced by them; and the misery is,example, that so terrible shows in the wreck ofmaidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,but that they are limed with the twigs that threatenthem.
I hope I need not to advise you further; butI hope your own grace will keep you where you are,though there were no further danger known but themodesty which is so lost.
DIANA
You shall not need to fear me.
Widow
I hope so.
Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie atmy house; thither they send one another: I'llquestion her.
God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?HELENA
To Saint Jaques le Grand.
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
Widow
At the Saint Francis here beside the port.
HELENA
Is this the way?
Widow
Ay, marry, is't.
Hark you! they come this way.
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,But till the troops come by,I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;The rather, for I think I know your hostessAs ample as myself.
HELENA
Is it yourself?
Widow
If you shall please so, pilgrim.
HELENA
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
Widow
You came, I think, from France?
HELENA
I did so.
Widow
Here you shall see a countryman of yoursThat has done worthy service.
HELENA
His name, I pray you.
DIANA
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
HELENA
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:His face I know not.
DIANA
Whatsome'er he is,He's bravely taken here.
He stole from France,As 'tis reported, for the king had married himAgainst his liking: think you it is so?
HELENA
Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.
DIANA
There is a gentleman that serves the countReports but coarsely of her.
HELENA
What's his name?
DIANA
Monsieur Parolles.
HELENA
                  O, I believe with him,In argument of praise, or to the worthOf the great count himself, she is too meanTo have her name repeated: all her deservingIs a reserved honesty, and thatI have not heard examined.
DIANA
Alas, poor lady!
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wifeOf a detesting lord.
Widow
I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do herA shrewd turn, if she pleased.
HELENA
How do you mean?
May be the amorous count solicits herIn the unlawful purpose.
Widow
He does indeed;And brokes with all that can in such a suitCorrupt the tender honour of a maid:But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guardIn honestest defence.
MARIANA
The gods forbid else!
Widow
So, now they come:That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;That, Escalus.
HELENA
Which is the Frenchman?
DIANA
He;That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
I would he loved his wife: if he were honesterHe were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?
HELENA
I like him well.
DIANA
'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knaveThat leads him to these places: were I his lady,I would Poison that vile rascal.
HELENA
Which is he?
DIANA
That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?
HELENA
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.
PAROLLES
Lose our drum! well.
MARIANA
He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.
Widow
Marry, hang you!
MARIANA
And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
Widow
The troop is past.
Come, pilgrim, I will bring youWhere you shall host: of enjoin'd penitentsThere's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,Already at my house.
HELENA
I humbly thank you:Please it this matron and this gentle maidTo eat with us to-night, the charge and thankingShall be for me; and, to requite you further,I will bestow some precepts of this virginWorthy the note.
BOTH
We'll take your offer kindly.
