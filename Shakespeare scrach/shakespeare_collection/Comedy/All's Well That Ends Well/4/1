Without the Florentine camp.
Second Lord
He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
When you sally upon him, speak what terriblelanguage you will: though you understand it notyourselves, no matter; for we must not seem tounderstand him, unless some one among us whom wemust produce for an interpreter.
First Soldier
Good captain, let me be the interpreter.
Second Lord
Art not acquainted with him?
knows he not thy voice?First Soldier
No, sir, I warrant you.
Second Lord
But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
First Soldier
E'en such as you speak to me.
Second Lord
He must think us some band of strangers i' theadversary's entertainment.
Now he hath a smack ofall neighbouring languages; therefore we must everyone be a man of his own fancy, not to know what wespeak one to another; so we seem to know, is toknow straight our purpose: choughs' language,gabble enough, and good enough.
As for you,interpreter, you must seem very politic.
But couch,ho!
here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
PAROLLES
Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill betime enough to go home.
What shall I say I havedone?
It must be a very plausive invention thatcarries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraceshave of late knocked too often at my door.
I findmy tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath thefear of Mars before it and of his creatures, notdaring the reports of my tongue.
Second Lord
This is the first truth that e'er thine own tonguewas guilty of.
PAROLLES
What the devil should move me to undertake therecovery of this drum, being not ignorant of theimpossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose?
Imust give myself some hurts, and say I got them inexploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; theywill say, 'Came you off with so little?
' and greatones I dare not give.
Wherefore, what's theinstance?
Tongue, I must put you into abutter-woman's mouth and buy myself another ofBajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
Second Lord
Is it possible he should know what he is, and bethat he is?
PAROLLES
I would the cutting of my garments would serve theturn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
Second Lord
We cannot afford you so.
PAROLLES
Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was instratagem.
Second Lord
'Twould not do.
PAROLLES
Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.
Second Lord
Hardly serve.
PAROLLES
Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
Second Lord
How deep?
PAROLLES
Thirty fathom.
Second Lord
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
PAROLLES
I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swearI recovered it.
Second Lord
You shall hear one anon.
PAROLLES
A drum now of the enemy's,--Second Lord
Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
All
Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.
PAROLLES
O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.
First Soldier
Boskos thromuldo boskos.
PAROLLES
I know you are the Muskos' regiment:And I shall lose my life for want of language;If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'llDiscover that which shall undo the Florentine.
First Soldier
Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speakthy tongue.
Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thyfaith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
PAROLLES
O!
First Soldier
O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
Second Lord
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
First Soldier
The general is content to spare thee yet;And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee onTo gather from thee: haply thou mayst informSomething to save thy life.
PAROLLES
O, let me live!
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak thatWhich you will wonder at.
First Soldier
But wilt thou faithfully?
PAROLLES
If I do not, damn me.
First Soldier
Acordo linta.
Come on; thou art granted space.
Second Lord
Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffledTill we do hear from them.
Second Soldier
Captain, I will.
Second Lord
A' will betray us all unto ourselves:Inform on that.
Second Soldier
So I will, sir.
Second Lord
Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
