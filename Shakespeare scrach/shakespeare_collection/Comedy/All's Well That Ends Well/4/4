Florence. The Widow's house.
HELENA
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,One of the greatest in the Christian worldShall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:Time was, I did him a desired office,Dear almost as his life; which gratitudeThrough flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'dHis grace is at Marseilles; to which placeWe have convenient convoy.
You must knowI am supposed dead: the army breaking,My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,And by the leave of my good lord the king,We'll be before our welcome.
Widow
Gentle madam,You never had a servant to whose trustYour business was more welcome.
HELENA
Nor you, mistress,Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labourTo recompense your love: doubt not but heavenHath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,As it hath fated her to be my motiveAnd helper to a husband.
But, O strange men!That can such sweet use make of what they hate,When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughtsDefiles the pitchy night: so lust doth playWith what it loathes for that which is away.
But more of this hereafter.
You, Diana,Under my poor instructions yet must sufferSomething in my behalf.
DIANA
Let death and honestyGo with your impositions, I am yoursUpon your will to suffer.
HELENA
Yet, I pray you:But with the word the time will bring on summer,When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,And be as sweet as sharp.
We must away;Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.
