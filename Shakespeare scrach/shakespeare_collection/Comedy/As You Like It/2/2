DUKE FREDERICK
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be: some villains of my courtAre of consent and sufferance in this.
First Lord
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,Saw her abed, and in the morning earlyThey found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
Second Lord
My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oftYour grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,Confesses that she secretly o'erheardYour daughter and her cousin much commendThe parts and graces of the wrestlerThat did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;And she believes, wherever they are gone,That youth is surely in their company.
DUKE FREDERICK
Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;If he be absent, bring his brother to me;I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,And let not search and inquisition quailTo bring again these foolish runaways.
