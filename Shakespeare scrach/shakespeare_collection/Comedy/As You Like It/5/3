I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it isno dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of theworld.

Well met, honest gentleman.

Come, sit, sit, and a song.Second Page

Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking orspitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the onlyprologues to a bad voice?
Second Page
I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like twogipsies on a horse.
SONG.
It was a lover and his lass,With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,That o'er the green corn-field did passIn the spring time, the only pretty ring time,When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:Sweet lovers love the spring.
Between the acres of the rye,With a hey, and a ho, and a hey noninoThese pretty country folks would lie,In spring time,  & c.
This carol they began that hour,With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,How that a life was but a flowerIn spring time,  & c.
And therefore take the present time,With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;For love is crowned with the primeIn spring time,  & c.
TOUCHSTONE
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no greatmatter in the ditty, yet the note was veryuntuneable.
First Page
You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.
TOUCHSTONE
By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hearsuch a foolish song.
God be wi' you; and God mendyour voices! Come, Audrey.
