Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.
CLOTEN
Was there ever man had such luck!
when I kissed thejack, upon an up-cast to be hit away!
I had ahundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapesmust take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mineoaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
First Lord
What got he by that?
You have broke his pate withyour bowl.
Second Lord
[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,it would have run all out.
CLOTEN
When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not forany standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?
Second Lord
No my lord;nor crop the ears of them.
CLOTEN
Whoreson dog!
I give him satisfaction?Would he had been one of my rank!
Second Lord
[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.
CLOTEN
I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: apox on't!
I had rather not be so noble as I am;they dare not fight with me, because of the queen mymother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful offighting, and I must go up and down like a cock thatnobody can match.
Second Lord
[Aside]  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,cock, with your comb on.
CLOTEN
Sayest thou?
Second Lord
It is not fit your lordship should undertake everycompanion that you give offence to.
CLOTEN
No, I know that: but it is fit I should commitoffence to my inferiors.
Second Lord
Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
CLOTEN
Why, so I say.
First Lord
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
CLOTEN
A stranger, and I not know on't!
Second Lord
[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows itnot.
First Lord
There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one ofLeonatus' friends.
CLOTEN
Leonatus!
a banished rascal; and he's another,whatsoever he be.
Who told you of this stranger?First Lord
One of your lordship's pages.
CLOTEN
Is it fit I went to look upon him?
is there noderogation in't?
Second Lord
You cannot derogate, my lord.
CLOTEN
Not easily, I think.
Second Lord
[Aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore yourissues, being foolish, do not derogate.
CLOTEN
Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lostto-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him.
Come, go.Second Lord
I'll attend your lordship.
That such a crafty devil as is his motherShould yield the world this ass!
a woman thatBears all down with her brain; and this her sonCannot take two from twenty, for his heart,And leave eighteen.
Alas, poor princess,Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,A mother hourly coining plots, a wooerMore hateful than the foul expulsion isOf thy dear husband, than that horrid actOf the divorce he'ld make!
The heavens hold firmThe walls of thy dear honour, keep unshakedThat temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!
