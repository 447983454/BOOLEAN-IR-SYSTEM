A street.
DOGBERRY
Are you good men and true?
VERGES
Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffersalvation, body and soul.
DOGBERRY
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, ifthey should have any allegiance in them, beingchosen for the prince's watch.
VERGES
Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
DOGBERRY
First, who think you the most desertless man to beconstable?
First Watchman
Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they canwrite and read.
DOGBERRY
Come hither, neighbour Seacole.
God hath blessedyou with a good name: to be a well-favoured man isthe gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
Second Watchman
Both which, master constable,--DOGBERRY
You have: I knew it would be your answer.
Well,for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and makeno boast of it; and for your writing and reading,let that appear when there is no need of suchvanity.
You are thought here to be the mostsenseless and fit man for the constable of thewatch; therefore bear you the lantern.
This is yourcharge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you areto bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
Second Watchman
How if a' will not stand?
DOGBERRY
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; andpresently call the rest of the watch together andthank God you are rid of a knave.
VERGES
If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is noneof the prince's subjects.
DOGBERRY
True, and they are to meddle with none but theprince's subjects.
You shall also make no noise inthe streets; for, for the watch to babble and totalk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
Watchman
We will rather sleep than talk: we know whatbelongs to a watch.
DOGBERRY
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quietwatchman; for I cannot see how sleeping shouldoffend: only, have a care that your bills be notstolen.
Well, you are to call at all theale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
Watchman
How if they will not?
DOGBERRY
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: ifthey make you not then the better answer, you maysay they are not the men you took them for.
Watchman
Well, sir.
DOGBERRY
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtueof your office, to be no true man; and, for suchkind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,why the more is for your honesty.
Watchman
If we know him to be a thief, shall we not layhands on him?
DOGBERRY
Truly, by your office, you may; but I think theythat touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceableway for you, if you do take a thief, is to let himshow himself what he is and steal out of your company.
VERGES
You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
DOGBERRY
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much morea man who hath any honesty in him.
VERGES
If you hear a child cry in the night, you must callto the nurse and bid her still it.
Watchman
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
DOGBERRY
Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wakeher with crying; for the ewe that will not hear herlamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
VERGES
'Tis very true.
DOGBERRY
This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, areto present the prince's own person: if you meet theprince in the night, you may stay him.
VERGES
Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.
DOGBERRY
Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knowsthe statutes, he may stay him: marry, not withoutthe prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch oughtto offend no man; and it is an offence to stay aman against his will.
VERGES
By'r lady, I think it be so.
DOGBERRY
Ha, ha, ha!
Well, masters, good night: an there beany matter of weight chances, call up me: keep yourfellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
Come, neighbour.
Watchman
Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit hereupon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.
DOGBERRY
One word more, honest neighbours.
I pray you watchabout Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding beingthere to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.
BORACHIO
What Conrade!
Watchman
[Aside]  Peace! stir not.
BORACHIO
Conrade, I say!
CONRADE
Here, man; I am at thy elbow.
BORACHIO
Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would ascab follow.
CONRADE
I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forwardwith thy tale.
BORACHIO
Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, forit drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,utter all to thee.
Watchman
[Aside]  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.
BORACHIO
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
CONRADE
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
BORACHIO
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible anyvillany should be so rich; for when rich villainshave need of poor ones, poor ones may make whatprice they will.
CONRADE
I wonder at it.
BORACHIO
That shows thou art unconfirmed.
Thou knowest thatthe fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, isnothing to a man.
CONRADE
Yes, it is apparel.
BORACHIO
I mean, the fashion.
CONRADE
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
BORACHIO
Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool.
Butseest thou not what a deformed thief this fashionis?
Watchman
[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vilethief this seven year; a' goes up and down like agentleman: I remember his name.
BORACHIO
Didst thou not hear somebody?
CONRADE
No; 'twas the vane on the house.
BORACHIO
Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief thisfashion is?
how giddily a' turns about all the hotbloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiersin the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel'spriests in the old church-window, sometime like theshaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
CONRADE
All this I see; and I see that the fashion wearsout more apparel than the man.
But art not thouthyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hastshifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
BORACHIO
Not so, neither: but know that I have to-nightwooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by thename of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'chamber-window, bids me a thousand times goodnight,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should firsttell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,planted and placed and possessed by my master DonJohn, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
CONRADE
And thought they Margaret was Hero?
BORACHIO
Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but thedevil my master knew she was Margaret; and partlyby his oaths, which first possessed them, partly bythe dark night, which did deceive them, but chieflyby my villany, which did confirm any slander thatDon John had made, away went Claudio enraged; sworehe would meet her, as he was appointed, next morningat the temple, and there, before the wholecongregation, shame her with what he saw o'er nightand send her home again without a husband.
First Watchman
We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!
Second Watchman
Call up the right master constable.
We have hererecovered the most dangerous piece of lechery thatever was known in the commonwealth.
First Watchman
And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'wears a lock.
CONRADE
Masters, masters,--Second Watchman
You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
CONRADE
Masters,--First Watchman
Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.
BORACHIO
We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being takenup of these men's bills.
CONRADE
A commodity in question, I warrant you.
Come, we'll obey you.
