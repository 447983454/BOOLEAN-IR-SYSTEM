A room in the Garter Inn.
FALSTAFF
I will not lend thee a penny.
PISTOL
Why, then the world's mine oyster.
Which I with sword will open.
FALSTAFF
Not a penny.
I have been content, sir, you shouldlay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon mygood friends for three reprieves for you and yourcoach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked throughthe grate, like a geminy of baboons.
I am damned inhell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you weregood soldiers and tall fellows; and when MistressBridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't uponmine honour thou hadst it not.
PISTOL
Didst not thou share?
hadst thou not fifteen pence?FALSTAFF
Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'llendanger my soul gratis?
At a word, hang no moreabout me, I am no gibbet for you.
Go. A short knifeand a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue!
youstand upon your honour!
Why, thou unconfinablebaseness, it is as much as I can do to keep theterms of my honour precise: I, I, I myselfsometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left handand hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain toshuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountainlooks, your red-lattice phrases, and yourbold-beating oaths, under the shelter of yourhonour!
You will not do it, you!PISTOL
I do relent: what would thou more of man?
ROBIN
Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
FALSTAFF
Let her approach.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Give your worship good morrow.
FALSTAFF
Good morrow, good wife.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Not so, an't please your worship.
FALSTAFF
Good maid, then.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
I'll be sworn,As my mother was, the first hour I was born.
FALSTAFF
I do believe the swearer.
What with me?MISTRESS QUICKLY
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
FALSTAFF
Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe theethe hearing.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come alittle nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with masterDoctor Caius,--FALSTAFF
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--MISTRESS QUICKLY
Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,come a little nearer this ways.
FALSTAFF
I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mineown people.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!
FALSTAFF
Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Why, sir, she's a good creature.
Lord Lord! yourworship's a wanton!
Well, heaven forgive you and allof us, I pray!
FALSTAFF
Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--MISTRESS QUICKLY
Marry, this is the short and the long of it; youhave brought her into such a canaries as 'tiswonderful.
The best courtier of them all, when thecourt lay at Windsor, could never have brought herto such a canary.
Yet there has been knights, andlords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrantyou, coach after coach, letter after letter, giftafter gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and sorushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and insuch alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar ofthe best and the fairest, that would have won anywoman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could neverget an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angelsgiven me this morning; but I defy all angels, inany such sort, as they say, but in the way ofhonesty: and, I warrant you, they could never gether so much as sip on a cup with the proudest ofthem all: and yet there has been earls, nay, whichis more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
FALSTAFF
But what says she to me?
be brief, my goodshe-Mercury.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Marry, she hath received your letter, for the whichshe thanks you a thousand times; and she gives youto notify that her husband will be absence from hishouse between ten and eleven.
FALSTAFF
Ten and eleven?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see thepicture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,her husband, will be from home.
Alas! the sweetwoman leads an ill life with him: he's a veryjealousy man: she leads a very frampold life withhim, good heart.
FALSTAFF
Ten and eleven.
Woman, commend me to her; I willnot fail her.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Why, you say well.
But I have another messenger toyour worship.
Mistress Page hath her heartycommendations to you too: and let me tell you inyour ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, andone, I tell you, that will not miss you morning norevening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be theother: and she bade me tell your worship that herhusband is seldom from home; but she hopes therewill come a time.
I never knew a woman so dote upona man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.
FALSTAFF
Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of mygood parts aside I have no other charms.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Blessing on your heart for't!
FALSTAFF
But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife andPage's wife acquainted each other how they love me?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
That were a jest indeed!
they have not so littlegrace, I hope: that were a trick indeed!
butMistress Page would desire you to send her yourlittle page, of all loves: her husband has amarvellous infection to the little page; and trulyMaster Page is an honest man.
Never a wife inWindsor leads a better life than she does: do whatshe will, say what she will, take all, pay all, goto bed when she list, rise when she list, all is asshe will: and truly she deserves it; for if therebe a kind woman in Windsor, she is one.
You mustsend her your page; no remedy.
FALSTAFF
Why, I will.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come andgo between you both; and in any case have anay-word, that you may know one another's mind, andthe boy never need to understand any thing; for'tis not good that children should know anywickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,as they say, and know the world.
FALSTAFF
Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there'smy purse; I am yet thy debtor.
Boy, go along withthis woman.
This news distracts me!
PISTOL
This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!
FALSTAFF
Sayest thou so, old Jack?
go thy ways; I'll makemore of thy old body than I have done.
Will theyyet look after thee?
Wilt thou, after the expenseof so much money, be now a gainer?
Good body, Ithank thee.
Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it befairly done, no matter.
BARDOLPH
Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fainspeak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hathsent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
FALSTAFF
Brook is his name?
BARDOLPH
Ay, sir.
FALSTAFF
Call him in.
Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow suchliquor.
Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Pagehave I encompassed you? go to; via!
FORD
Bless you, sir!
FALSTAFF
And you, sir!
Would you speak with me?FORD
I make bold to press with so little preparation uponyou.
FALSTAFF
You're welcome.
What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.FORD
Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.
FALSTAFF
Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.
FORD
Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;for I must let you understand I think myself inbetter plight for a lender than you are: the whichhath something embolden'd me to this unseasonedintrusion; for they say, if money go before, allways do lie open.
FALSTAFF
Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
FORD
Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, orhalf, for easing me of the carriage.
FALSTAFF
Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.
FORD
I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.
FALSTAFF
Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to beyour servant.
FORD
Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be briefwith you,--and you have been a man long known to me,though I had never so good means, as desire, to makemyself acquainted with you.
I shall discover athing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mineown imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you haveone eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,turn another into the register of your own; that Imay pass with a reproof the easier, sith youyourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.
FALSTAFF
Very well, sir; proceed.
FORD
There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband'sname is Ford.
FALSTAFF
Well, sir.
FORD
I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,bestowed much on her; followed her with a dotingobservance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardlygive me sight of her; not only bought many presentsto give her, but have given largely to many to knowwhat she would have given; briefly, I have pursuedher as love hath pursued me; which hath been on thewing of all occasions.
But whatsoever I havemerited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,I am sure, I have received none; unless experiencebe a jewel that I have purchased at an infiniterate, and that hath taught me to say this:'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.
'FALSTAFF
Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?
FORD
Never.
FALSTAFF
Have you importuned her to such a purpose?
FORD
Never.
FALSTAFF
Of what quality was your love, then?
FORD
Like a fair house built on another man's ground; sothat I have lost my edifice by mistaking the placewhere I erected it.
FALSTAFF
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
FORD
When I have told you that, I have told you all.
Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet inother places she enlargeth her mirth so far thatthere is shrewd construction made of her.
Now, SirJohn, here is the heart of my purpose: you are agentleman of excellent breeding, admirablediscourse, of great admittance, authentic in yourplace and person, generally allowed for your manywar-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
FALSTAFF
O, sir!
FORD
Believe it, for you know it.
There is money; spendit, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; onlygive me so much of your time in exchange of it, asto lay an amiable siege to the honesty of thisFord's wife: use your art of wooing; win her toconsent to you: if any man may, you may as soon asany.
FALSTAFF
Would it apply well to the vehemency of youraffection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
FORD
O, understand my drift.
She dwells so securely onthe excellency of her honour, that the folly of mysoul dares not present itself: she is too bright tobe looked against.
Now, could I could come to herwith any detection in my hand, my desires hadinstance and argument to commend themselves: Icould drive her then from the ward of her purity,her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousandother her defences, which now are too too stronglyembattled against me.
What say you to't, Sir John?FALSTAFF
Master Brook, I will first make bold with yourmoney; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am agentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
FORD
O good sir!
FALSTAFF
I say you shall.
FORD
Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
FALSTAFF
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall wantnone.
I shall be with her, I may tell you, by herown appointment; even as you came in to me, herassistant or go-between parted from me: I say Ishall be with her between ten and eleven; for atthat time the jealous rascally knave her husbandwill be forth.
Come you to me at night; you shallknow how I speed.
FORD
I am blest in your acquaintance.
Do you know Ford,sir?
FALSTAFF
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave!
I know him not:yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say thejealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for thewhich his wife seems to me well-favored.
I willuse her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;and there's my harvest-home.
FORD
I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid himif you saw him.
FALSTAFF
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue!
I willstare him out of his wits; I will awe him with mycudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er thecuckold's horns.
Master Brook, thou shalt know Iwill predominate over the peasant, and thou shaltlie with his wife.
Come to me soon at night.Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave andcuckold.
Come to me soon at night.FORD
What a damned Epicurean rascal is this!
My heart isready to crack with impatience.
Who says this isimprovident jealousy?
my wife hath sent to him; thehour is fixed; the match is made.
Would any manhave thought this?
See the hell of having a falsewoman!
My bed shall be abused, my coffersransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall notonly receive this villanous wrong, but stand underthe adoption of abominable terms, and by him thatdoes me this wrong.
Terms! names! Amaimon soundswell; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they aredevils' additions, the names of fiends: butCuckold!
Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hathnot such a name.
Page is an ass, a secure ass: hewill trust his wife; he will not be jealous.
I willrather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hughthe Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with myaqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my amblinggelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,then she ruminates, then she devises; and what theythink in their hearts they may effect, they willbreak their hearts but they will effect.
God bepraised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged onFalstaff, and laugh at Page.
I will about it;better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
Fie, fie, fie!
cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!
