Another part of the island.
STEPHANO
Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drinkwater; not a drop before: therefore bear up, andboard 'em.
Servant-monster, drink to me.TRINCULO
Servant-monster!
the folly of this island! Theysay there's but five upon this isle: we are threeof them; if th' other two be brained like us, thestate totters.
STEPHANO
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyesare almost set in thy head.
TRINCULO
Where should they be set else?
he were a bravemonster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
STEPHANO
My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere Icould recover the shore, five and thirty leagues offand on.
By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,monster, or my standard.
TRINCULO
Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
STEPHANO
We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
TRINCULO
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet saynothing neither.
STEPHANO
Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest agood moon-calf.
CALIBAN
How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
TRINCULO
Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case tojustle a constable.
Why, thou deboshed fish thou,was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so muchsack as I to-day?
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,being but half a fish and half a monster?
CALIBAN
Lo, how he mocks me!
wilt thou let him, my lord?TRINCULO
'Lord' quoth he!
That a monster should be such a natural!CALIBAN
Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
STEPHANO
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if youprove a mutineer,--the next tree!
The poor monster'smy subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
CALIBAN
I thank my noble lord.
Wilt thou be pleased tohearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
STEPHANO
Marry, will I	kneel and repeat it; I will stand,and so shall Trinculo.
CALIBAN
As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, asorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
ARIEL
Thou liest.
CALIBAN
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would myvaliant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.
STEPHANO
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, bythis hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
TRINCULO
Why, I said nothing.
STEPHANO
Mum, then, and no more.
Proceed.CALIBAN
I say, by sorcery he got this isle;From me he got it.
if thy greatness willRevenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,But this thing dare not,--STEPHANO
That's most certain.
CALIBAN
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
STEPHANO
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party?
CALIBAN
Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
ARIEL
Thou liest; thou canst not.
CALIBAN
What a pied ninny's this!
Thou scurvy patch!I do beseech thy greatness, give him blowsAnd take his bottle from him: when that's goneHe shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show himWhere the quick freshes are.
STEPHANO
Trinculo, run into no further danger:interrupt the monster one word further, and,by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doorsand make a stock-fish of thee.
TRINCULO
Why, what did I? I did nothing.
I'll go fartheroff.
STEPHANO
Didst thou not say he lied?
ARIEL
Thou liest.
STEPHANO
Do I so? take thou that.
As you like this, give me the lie another time.
TRINCULO
I did not give the lie.
Out o' yourwits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
this can sack and drinking do.
A murrain onyour monster, and the devil take your fingers!
CALIBAN
Ha, ha, ha!
STEPHANO
Now, forward with your tale.
Prithee, stand fartheroff.
CALIBAN
Beat him enough: after a little timeI'll beat him too.
STEPHANO
Stand farther.
Come, proceed.CALIBAN
Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,Having first seized his books, or with a logBatter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,Or cut his wezand with thy knife.
RememberFirst to possess his books; for without themHe's but a sot, as I am, nor hath notOne spirit to command: they all do hate himAs rootedly as I.
Burn but his books.He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--Which when he has a house, he'll deck withalAnd that most deeply to consider isThe beauty of his daughter; he himselfCalls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,But only Sycorax my dam and she;But she as far surpasseth SycoraxAs great'st does least.
STEPHANO
Is it so brave a lass?
CALIBAN
Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
And bring thee forth brave brood.
STEPHANO
Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and Iwill be king and queen--save our graces!
--andTrinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.
Dost thoulike the plot, Trinculo?
TRINCULO
Excellent.
STEPHANO
Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
CALIBAN
Within this half hour will he be asleep:Wilt thou destroy him then?
STEPHANO
Ay, on mine honour.
ARIEL
This will I tell my master.
CALIBAN
Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:Let us be jocund: will you troll the catchYou taught me but while-ere?
STEPHANO
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, anyreason.
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.Flout 'em and scout 'emAnd scout 'em and flout 'emThought is free.
CALIBAN
That's not the tune.
STEPHANO
What is this same?
TRINCULO
This is the tune of our catch, played by the pictureof Nobody.
STEPHANO
If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
TRINCULO
O, forgive me my sins!
STEPHANO
He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee.
Mercy upon us!CALIBAN
Art thou afeard?
STEPHANO
No, monster, not I.
CALIBAN
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instrumentsWill hum about mine ears, and sometime voicesThat, if I then had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,The clouds methought would open and show richesReady to drop upon me that, when I waked,I cried to dream again.
STEPHANO
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shallhave my music for nothing.
CALIBAN
When Prospero is destroyed.
STEPHANO
That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
TRINCULO
The sound is going away; let's follow it, andafter do our work.
STEPHANO
Lead, monster; we'll follow.
I would I could seethis tabourer; he lays it on.
TRINCULO
Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.
