Plain between the camps.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
What is thy name, that in the battle thusThou crossest me?
what honour dost thou seekUpon my head?
EARL OF DOUGLAS
                  Know then, my name is Douglas;And I do haunt thee in the battle thusBecause some tell me that thou art a king.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
They tell thee true.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath boughtThy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
SIR WALTER BLUNT
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;And thou shalt find a king that will revengeLord Stafford's death.
HOTSPUR
O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.
HOTSPUR
Where?
EARL OF DOUGLAS
Here.
HOTSPUR
This, Douglas?
no: I know this face full well:A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
HOTSPUR
The king hath many marching in his coats.
EARL OF DOUGLAS
Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,Until I meet the king.
HOTSPUR
Up, and away!
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
FALSTAFF
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fearthe shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.
Soft!
who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honourfor you!
here's no vanity! I am as hot as moultenlead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me!
Ineed no more weight than mine own bowels.
I haveled my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there'snot three of my hundred and fifty left alive; andthey are for the town's end, to beg during life.
But who comes here?
PRINCE HENRY
What, stand'st thou idle here?
lend me thy sword:Many a nobleman lies stark and stiffUnder the hoofs of vaunting enemies,Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,lend me thy sword.
FALSTAFF
O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I havedone this day.
I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.PRINCE HENRY
He is, indeed; and living to kill thee.
I prithee,lend me thy sword.
FALSTAFF
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'stnot my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.
PRINCE HENRY
Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
FALSTAFF
Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.
PRINCE HENRY
What, is it a time to jest and dally now?
FALSTAFF
Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him.
If he docome in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in hiswillingly, let him make a carbonado of me.
I likenot such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give melife: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comesunlooked for, and there's an end.
