The Tower-walls.
GLOUCESTER
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,And then begin again, and stop again,As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
BUCKINGHAM
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;Speak and look back, and pry on every side,Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looksAre at my service, like enforced smiles;And both are ready in their offices,At any time, to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?
GLOUCESTER
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
BUCKINGHAM
Lord mayor,--GLOUCESTER
Look to the drawbridge there!
BUCKINGHAM
Hark! a drum.
GLOUCESTER
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
BUCKINGHAM
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--GLOUCESTER
Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
BUCKINGHAM
God and our innocency defend and guard us!
GLOUCESTER
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
LOVEL
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
GLOUCESTER
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creatureThat breathed upon this earth a Christian;Made him my book wherein my soul recordedThe history of all her secret thoughts:So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,That, his apparent open guilt omitted,I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,He lived from all attainder of suspect.
BUCKINGHAM
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitorThat ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,Were't not that, by great preservation,We live to tell it you, the subtle traitorThis day had plotted, in the council-houseTo murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
Lord Mayor
What, had he so?
GLOUCESTER
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of law,Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,But that the extreme peril of the case,The peace of England and our persons' safety,Enforced us to this execution?
Lord Mayor
Now, fair befall you!
he deserved his death;And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never look'd for better at his hands,After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
GLOUCESTER
Yet had not we determined he should die,Until your lordship came to see his death;Which now the loving haste of these our friends,Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:Because, my lord, we would have had you heardThe traitor speak, and timorously confessThe manner and the purpose of his treason;That you might well have signified the sameUnto the citizens, who haply mayMisconstrue us in him and wail his death.
Lord Mayor
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,As well as I had seen and heard him speakAnd doubt you not, right noble princes both,But I'll acquaint our duteous citizensWith all your just proceedings in this cause.
GLOUCESTER
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,To avoid the carping censures of the world.
BUCKINGHAM
But since you come too late of our intents,Yet witness what you hear we did intend:And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
GLOUCESTER
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,Only for saying he would make his sonHeir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxuryAnd bestial appetite in change of lust;Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,Without control, listed to make his prey.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:Tell them, when that my mother went with childOf that unsatiate Edward, noble YorkMy princely father then had wars in FranceAnd, by just computation of the time,Found that the issue was not his begot;Which well appeared in his lineaments,Being nothing like the noble duke my father:But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
BUCKINGHAM
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the oratorAs if the golden fee for which I pleadWere for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
GLOUCESTER
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;Where you shall find me well accompaniedWith reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
BUCKINGHAM
I go: and towards three or four o'clockLook for the news that the Guildhall affords.
GLOUCESTER
Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them bothMeet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
Now will I in, to take some privy order,To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;And to give notice, that no manner of personAt any time have recourse unto the princes.
