London. The palace.
KING RICHARD III
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
BUCKINGHAM
My gracious sovereign?
KING RICHARD III
Give me thy hand.
Thus high, by thy adviceAnd thy assistance, is King Richard seated;But shall we wear these honours for a day?
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
BUCKINGHAM
Still live they and for ever may they last!
KING RICHARD III
O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,To try if thou be current gold indeedYoung Edward lives: think now what I would say.
BUCKINGHAM
Say on, my loving lord.
KING RICHARD III
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,BUCKINGHAM
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
KING RICHARD III
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
BUCKINGHAM
True, noble prince.
KING RICHARD III
O bitter consequence,That Edward still should live!
'True, noble prince!'Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:Shall I be plain?
I wish the bastards dead;And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.
BUCKINGHAM
Your grace may do your pleasure.
KING RICHARD III
Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
BUCKINGHAM
Give me some breath, some little pause, my lordBefore I positively herein:I will resolve your grace immediately.
CATESBY
[Aside to a stander by]The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.
KING RICHARD III
I will converse with iron-witted foolsAnd unrespective boys: none are for meThat look into me with considerate eyes:High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!
Page
My lord?
KING RICHARD III
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting goldWould tempt unto a close exploit of death?
Page
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:Gold were as good as twenty orators,And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
KING RICHARD III
What is his name?
Page
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
KING RICHARD III
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
The deep-revolving witty BuckinghamNo more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:Hath he so long held out with me untired,And stops he now for breath?
How now!
what news with you?STANLEY
My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fledTo Richmond, in those parts beyond the seaWhere he abides.
KING RICHARD III
Catesby!
CATESBY
My lord?
KING RICHARD III
                         Rumour it abroadThat Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how thou dream'st!
I say again, give outThat Anne my wife is sick and like to die:About it; for it stands me much upon,To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
I must be married to my brother's daughter,Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
Uncertain way of gain!
But I am inSo far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Is thy name Tyrrel?
TYRREL
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
KING RICHARD III
Art thou, indeed?
TYRREL
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
KING RICHARD III
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
TYRREL
Ay, my lord;But I had rather kill two enemies.
KING RICHARD III
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbersAre they that I would have thee deal upon:Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
TYRREL
Let me have open means to come to them,And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
KING RICHARD III
Thou sing'st sweet music.
Hark, come hither, TyrrelGo, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:There is no more but so: say it is done,And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
TYRREL
'Tis done, my gracious lord.
KING RICHARD III
Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
TYRREL
Ye shall, my Lord.
BUCKINGHAM
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mindThe late demand that you did sound me in.
KING RICHARD III
Well, let that pass.
Dorset is fled to Richmond.BUCKINGHAM
I hear that news, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
BUCKINGHAM
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;The earldom of Hereford and the moveablesThe which you promised I should possess.
KING RICHARD III
Stanley, look to your wife; if she conveyLetters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
BUCKINGHAM
What says your highness to my just demand?
KING RICHARD III
As I remember, Henry the SixthDid prophesy that Richmond should be king,When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--BUCKINGHAM
My lord!
KING RICHARD III
How chance the prophet could not at that timeHave told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
BUCKINGHAM
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--KING RICHARD III
Richmond!
When last I was at Exeter,The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,Because a bard of Ireland told me onceI should not live long after I saw Richmond.
BUCKINGHAM
My Lord!
KING RICHARD III
Ay, what's o'clock?
BUCKINGHAM
I am thus bold to put your grace in mindOf what you promised me.
KING RICHARD III
Well, but what's o'clock?
BUCKINGHAM
Upon the stroke of ten.
KING RICHARD III
Well, let it strike.
BUCKINGHAM
Why let it strike?
KING RICHARD III
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the strokeBetwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to-day.
BUCKINGHAM
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
KING RICHARD III
Tut, tut,Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
BUCKINGHAM
Is it even so?
rewards he my true serviceWith such deep contempt made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings, and be goneTo Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
