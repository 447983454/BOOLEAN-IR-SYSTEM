Near Misenum.
POMPEY
Your hostages I have, so have you mine;And we shall talk before we fight.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Most meetThat first we come to words; and therefore have weOur written purposes before us sent;Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us knowIf 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,And carry back to Sicily much tall youthThat else must perish here.
POMPEY
To you all three,The senators alone of this great world,Chief factors for the gods, I do not knowWherefore my father should revengers want,Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,There saw you labouring for him.
What was'tThat moved pale Cassius to conspire; and whatMade the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,To drench the Capitol; but that they wouldHave one man but a man?
And that is itHath made me rig my navy; at whose burthenThe anger'd ocean foams; with which I meantTo scourge the ingratitude that despiteful RomeCast on my noble father.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Take your time.
MARK ANTONY
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'stHow much we do o'er-count thee.
POMPEY
At land, indeed,Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,Remain in't as thou mayst.
LEPIDUS
Be pleased to tell us--For this is from the present--how you takeThe offers we have sent you.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
There's the point.
MARK ANTONY
Which do not be entreated to, but weighWhat it is worth embraced.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
And what may follow,To try a larger fortune.
POMPEY
You have made me offerOf Sicily, Sardinia; and I mustRid all the sea of pirates; then, to sendMeasures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed uponTo part with unhack'd edges, and bear backOur targes undinted.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
MARK ANTONY
LEPIDUS
That's our offer.
POMPEY
Know, then,I came before you here a man preparedTo take this offer: but Mark AntonyPut me to some impatience: though I loseThe praise of it by telling, you must know,When Caesar and your brother were at blows,Your mother came to Sicily and did findHer welcome friendly.
MARK ANTONY
I have heard it, Pompey;And am well studied for a liberal thanksWhich I do owe you.
POMPEY
Let me have your hand:I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
MARK ANTONY
The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;For I have gain'd by 't.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Since I saw you last,There is a change upon you.
POMPEY
Well, I know notWhat counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;But in my bosom shall she never come,To make my heart her vassal.
LEPIDUS
Well met here.
POMPEY
I hope so, Lepidus.
Thus we are agreed:I crave our composition may be written,And seal'd between us.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
That's the next to do.
POMPEY
We'll feast each other ere we part; and let'sDraw lots who shall begin.
MARK ANTONY
That will I, Pompey.
POMPEY
No, Antony, take the lot: but, firstOr last, your fine Egyptian cookeryShall have the fame.
I have heard that Julius CaesarGrew fat with feasting there.
MARK ANTONY
You have heard much.
POMPEY
I have fair meanings, sir.
MARK ANTONY
And fair words to them.
POMPEY
Then so much have I heard:And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
No more of that: he did so.
POMPEY
What, I pray you?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
POMPEY
I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Well;And well am like to do; for, I perceive,Four feasts are toward.
POMPEY
Let me shake thy hand;I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,When I have envied thy behavior.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Sir,I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,When you have well deserved ten times as muchAs I have said you did.
POMPEY
Enjoy thy plainness,It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all:Will you lead, lords?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
MARK ANTONY
LEPIDUS
Show us the way, sir.
POMPEY
Come.
MENAS
[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er havemade this treaty.
--You and I have known, sir.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
At sea, I think.
MENAS
We have, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
You have done well by water.
MENAS
And you by land.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I will praise any man that will praise me; though itcannot be denied what I have done by land.
MENAS
Nor what I have done by water.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Yes, something you can deny for your ownsafety: you have been a great thief by sea.
MENAS
And you by land.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
There I deny my land service.
But give me yourhand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here theymight take two thieves kissing.
MENAS
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
MENAS
No slander; they steal hearts.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
We came hither to fight with you.
MENAS
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.
MENAS
You've said, sir.
We looked not for Mark Antonyhere: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
MENAS
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
MENAS
Pray ye, sir?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
'Tis true.
MENAS
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I wouldnot prophesy so.
MENAS
I think the policy of that purpose made more in themarriage than the love of the parties.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I think so too.
But you shall find, the band thatseems to tie their friendship together will be thevery strangler of their amity: Octavia is of aholy, cold, and still conversation.
MENAS
Who would not have his wife so?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall thesighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, asI said before, that which is the strength of theiramity shall prove the immediate author of theirvariance.
Antony will use his affection where it is:he married but his occasion here.
MENAS
And thus it may be.
Come, sir, will you aboard?I have a health for you.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
MENAS
Come, let's away.
