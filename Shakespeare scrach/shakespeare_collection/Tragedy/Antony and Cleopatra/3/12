Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Let him appear that's come from Antony.
Know you him?
DOLABELLA
                  Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:An argument that he is pluck'd, when hitherHe sends so poor a pinion off his wing,Which had superfluous kings for messengersNot many moons gone by.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Approach, and speak.
EUPHRONIUS
Such as I am, I come from Antony:I was of late as petty to his endsAs is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leafTo his grand sea.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Be't so: declare thine office.
EUPHRONIUS
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, andRequires to live in Egypt: which not granted,He lessens his requests; and to thee suesTo let him breathe between the heavens and earth,A private man in Athens: this for him.
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;Submits her to thy might; and of thee cravesThe circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,Now hazarded to thy grace.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
For Antony,I have no ears to his request.
The queenOf audience nor desire shall fail, so sheFrom Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,Or take his life there: this if she perform,She shall not sue unheard.
So to them both.EUPHRONIUS
Fortune pursue thee!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Bring him through the bands.
From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,And in our name, what she requires; add more,From thine invention, offers: women are notIn their best fortunes strong; but want will perjureThe ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;Make thine own edict for thy pains, which weWill answer as a law.
THYREUS
Caesar, I go.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,And what thou think'st his very action speaksIn every power that moves.
THYREUS
Caesar, I shall.
