Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:Our will is Antony be took alive;Make it so known.
AGRIPPA
Caesar, I shall.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
The time of universal peace is near:Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd worldShall bear the olive freely.
Messenger
AntonyIs come into the field.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Go charge AgrippaPlant those that have revolted in the van,That Antony may seem to spend his furyUpon himself.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry onAffairs of Antony; there did persuadeGreat Herod to incline himself to Caesar,And leave his master Antony: for this painsCaesar hath hang'd him.
Canidius and the restThat fell away have entertainment, butNo honourable trust.
I have done ill;Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,That I will joy no more.
Soldier
Enobarbus, AntonyHath after thee sent all thy treasure, withHis bounty overplus: the messengerCame on my guard; and at thy tent is nowUnloading of his mules.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I give it you.
Soldier
Mock not, Enobarbus.
I tell you true: best you safed the bringerOut of the host; I must attend mine office,Or would have done't myself.
Your emperorContinues still a Jove.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I am alone the villain of the earth,And feel I am so most.
O Antony,Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paidMy better service, when my turpitudeThou dost so crown with gold!
This blows my heart:If swift thought break it not, a swifter meanShall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
I fight against thee!
No: I will go seekSome ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fitsMy latter part of life.
