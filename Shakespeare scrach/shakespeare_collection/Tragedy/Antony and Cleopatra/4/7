Field of battle between the camps.
AGRIPPA
Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:Caesar himself has work, and our oppressionExceeds what we expected.
SCARUS
O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them homeWith clouts about their heads.
MARK ANTONY
Thou bleed'st apace.
SCARUS
I had a wound here that was like a T,But now 'tis made an H.
MARK ANTONY
They do retire.
SCARUS
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yetRoom for six scotches more.
EROS
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage servesFor a fair victory.
SCARUS
Let us score their backs,And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:'Tis sport to maul a runner.
MARK ANTONY
I will reward theeOnce for thy spritely comfort, and ten-foldFor thy good valour.
Come thee on.SCARUS
I'll halt after.
