Another room in the castle.
HAMLET
Safely stowed.
ROSENCRANTZ:
GUILDENSTERN:
[Within]  Hamlet!
Lord Hamlet!HAMLET
What noise?
who calls on Hamlet?O, here they come.
ROSENCRANTZ
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
HAMLET
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
ROSENCRANTZ
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thenceAnd bear it to the chapel.
HAMLET
Do not believe it.
ROSENCRANTZ
Believe what?
HAMLET
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge!
whatreplication should be made by the son of a king?
ROSENCRANTZ
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
HAMLET
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, hisrewards, his authorities.
But such officers do theking best service in the end: he keeps them, likean ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, tobe last swallowed: when he needs what you havegleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, youshall be dry again.
ROSENCRANTZ
I understand you not, my lord.
HAMLET
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in afoolish ear.
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and gowith us to the king.
HAMLET
The body is with the king, but the king is not withthe body.
The king is a thing--GUILDENSTERN
A thing, my lord!
HAMLET
Of nothing: bring me to him.
Hide fox, and all after.
