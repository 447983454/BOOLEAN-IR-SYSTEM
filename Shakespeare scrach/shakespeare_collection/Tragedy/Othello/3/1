Before the castle.
CASSIO
Masters, play here; I will content your pains;Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.
'Clown
Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,that they speak i' the nose thus?
First Musician
How, sir, how!
Clown
Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?
First Musician
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
Clown
O, thereby hangs a tail.
First Musician
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
Clown
Marry.
sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.But, masters, here's money for you: and the generalso likes your music, that he desires you, for love'ssake, to make no more noise with it.
First Musician
Well, sir, we will not.
Clown
If you have any music that may not be heard, to'tagain: but, as they say to hear music the generaldoes not greatly care.
First Musician
We have none such, sir.
Clown
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:go; vanish into air; away!
CASSIO
Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
Clown
No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
CASSIO
Prithee, keep up thy quillets.
There's a poor pieceof gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attendsthe general's wife be stirring, tell her there'sone Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:wilt thou do this?
Clown
She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, Ishall seem to notify unto her.
CASSIO
Do, good my friend.
In happy time, Iago.
IAGO
You have not been a-bed, then?
CASSIO
Why, no; the day had brokeBefore we parted.
I have made bold, Iago,To send in to your wife: my suit to herIs, that she will to virtuous DesdemonaProcure me some access.
IAGO
I'll send her to you presently;And I'll devise a mean to draw the MoorOut of the way, that your converse and businessMay be more free.
CASSIO
I humbly thank you for't.
I never knewA Florentine more kind and honest.
EMILIA
Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorryFor your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it;And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdomHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves youAnd needs no other suitor but his likingsTo take the safest occasion by the frontTo bring you in again.
CASSIO
Yet, I beseech you,If you think fit, or that it may be done,Give me advantage of some brief discourseWith Desdemona alone.
EMILIA
Pray you, come in;I will bestow you where you shall have timeTo speak your bosom freely.
CASSIO
I am much bound to you.
