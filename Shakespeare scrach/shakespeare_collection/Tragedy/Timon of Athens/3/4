The same. A hall in Timon's house.
Varro'sFirst Servant
Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.
TITUS
The like to you kind Varro.
HORTENSIUS
Lucius!
What, do we meet together?
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I thinkOne business does command us all; for mine Is money.
TITUS
So is theirs and ours.
Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!
PHILOTUS
Good day at once.
Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome, good brother.
What do you think the hour?
PHILOTUS
Labouring for nine.
Lucilius' Servant	So much?
PHILOTUS
Is not my lord seen yet?
Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.
PHILOTUS
I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:You must consider that a prodigal courseIs like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;That is one may reach deep enough, and yetFind little.
PHILOTUS
I am of your fear for that.
TITUS
I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
Your lord sends now for money.
HORTENSIUS
Most true, he does.
TITUS
And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,For which I wait for money.
HORTENSIUS
It is against my heart.
Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,Timon in this should pay more than he owes:And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,And send for money for 'em.
HORTENSIUS
I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
Varro'sFirst Servant
Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine.
Varro'sFirst Servant
'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,Your master's confidence was above mine;Else, surely, his had equall'd.
Enter FLAMINIUS.
TITUS
One of Lord Timon's men.
Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius!
Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready tocome forth?
FLAMINIUS
No, indeed, he is not.
TITUS
We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.
FLAMINIUS
I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.
Lucilius' Servant	Ha!
is not that his steward muffled so?He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.
TITUS
Do you hear, sir?
Varro'sSecond Servant
By your leave, sir,--FLAVIUS
What do ye ask of me, my friend?
TITUS
We wait for certain money here, sir.
FLAVIUS
Ay,If money were as certain as your waiting,'Twere sure enough.
Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debtsAnd take down the interest into theirgluttonous maws.
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;Let me pass quietly:Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve.
FLAVIUS
If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;For you serve knaves.
Varro'sFirst Servant
How!
what does his cashiered worship mutter?Varro'sSecond Servant
No matter what; he's poor, and that's revengeenough.
Who can speak broader than he that has nohouse to put his head in?
such may rail againstgreat buildings.
TITUS
O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
SERVILIUS
If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair someother hour, I should derive much from't; for,take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously todiscontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:And, if it be so far beyond his health,Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,And make a clear way to the gods.
SERVILIUS
Good gods!
TITUS
We cannot take this for answer, sir.
FLAMINIUS
[Within]  Servilius, help!
My lord! my lord!TIMON
What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
Have I been ever free, and must my houseBe my retentive enemy, my gaol?
The place which I have feasted, does it now,Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus.
TITUS
My lord, here is my bill.
Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine.
HORTENSIUS
And mine, my lord.
BothVarro's Servants	And ours, my lord.
PHILOTUS
All our bills.
TIMON
Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
Lucilius' Servant	Alas, my lord,-TIMON
Cut my heart in sums.
TITUS
Mine, fifty talents.
TIMON
Tell out my blood.
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand crowns, my lord.
TIMON
Five thousand drops pays that.
What yours?
--and yours?Varro'sFirst Servant
My lord,--Varro'sSecond Servant
My lord,--TIMON
Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!
HORTENSIUS
'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their capsat their money: these debts may well be calleddesperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.
TIMON
They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
Creditors? devils!
FLAVIUS
My dear lord,--TIMON
What if it should be so?
FLAVIUS
My lord,--TIMON
I'll have it so.
My steward!FLAVIUS
Here, my lord.
TIMON
So fitly?
Go, bid all my friends again,Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:All, sirrah, all:I'll once more feast the rascals.
FLAVIUS
O my lord,You only speak from your distracted soul;There is not so much left, to furnish outA moderate table.
TIMON
                  Be't not in thy care; go,I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tideOf knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
