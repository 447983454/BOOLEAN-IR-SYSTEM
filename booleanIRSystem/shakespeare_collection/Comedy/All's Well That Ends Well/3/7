Florence. The Widow's house.
HELENA
If you misdoubt me that I am not she,I know not how I shall assure you further,But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
Widow
Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,Nothing acquainted with these businesses;And would not put my reputation nowIn any staining act.
HELENA
Nor would I wish you.
First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,And what to your sworn counsel I have spokenIs so from word to word; and then you cannot,By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,Err in bestowing it.
Widow
I should believe you:For you have show'd me that which well approvesYou're great in fortune.
HELENA
Take this purse of gold,And let me buy your friendly help thus far,Which I will over-pay and pay againWhen I have found it.
The count he wooes your daughter,Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
Now his important blood will nought denyThat she'll demand: a ring the county wears,That downward hath succeeded in his houseFrom son to son, some four or five descentsSince the first father wore it: this ring he holdsIn most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,Howe'er repented after.
Widow
Now I seeThe bottom of your purpose.
HELENA
You see it lawful, then: it is no more,But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;In fine, delivers me to fill the time,Herself most chastely absent: after this,To marry her, I'll add three thousand crownsTo what is passed already.
Widow
I have yielded:Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,That time and place with this deceit so lawfulMay prove coherent.
Every night he comesWith musics of all sorts and songs composedTo her unworthiness: it nothing steads usTo chide him from our eaves; for he persistsAs if his life lay on't.
HELENA
Why then to-nightLet us assay our plot; which, if it speed,Is wicked meaning in a lawful deedAnd lawful meaning in a lawful act,Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:But let's about it.
