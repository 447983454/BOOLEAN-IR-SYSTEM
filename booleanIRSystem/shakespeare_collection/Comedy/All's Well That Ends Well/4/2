Florence. The Widow's house.
BERTRAM
They told me that your name was Fontibell.
DIANA
No, my good lord, Diana.
BERTRAM
Titled goddess;And worth it, with addition!
But, fair soul,In your fine frame hath love no quality?
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,You are no maiden, but a monument:When you are dead, you should be such a oneAs you are now, for you are cold and stem;And now you should be as your mother wasWhen your sweet self was got.
DIANA
She then was honest.
BERTRAM
So should you be.
DIANA
No:My mother did but duty; such, my lord,As you owe to your wife.
BERTRAM
No more o' that;I prithee, do not strive against my vows:I was compell'd to her; but I love theeBy love's own sweet constraint, and will for everDo thee all rights of service.
DIANA
Ay, so you serve usTill we serve you; but when you have our roses,You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselvesAnd mock us with our bareness.
BERTRAM
How have I sworn!
DIANA
'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
What is not holy, that we swear not by,But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,If I should swear by God's great attributes,I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,When I did love you ill?
This has no holding,To swear by him whom I protest to love,That I will work against him: therefore your oathsAre words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,At least in my opinion.
BERTRAM
Change it, change it;Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;And my integrity ne'er knew the craftsThat you do charge men with.
Stand no more off,But give thyself unto my sick desires,Who then recover: say thou art mine, and everMy love as it begins shall so persever.
DIANA
I see that men make ropes in such a scarreThat we'll forsake ourselves.
Give me that ring.BERTRAM
I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no powerTo give it from me.
DIANA
Will you not, my lord?
BERTRAM
It is an honour 'longing to our house,Bequeathed down from many ancestors;Which were the greatest obloquy i' the worldIn me to lose.
DIANA
                  Mine honour's such a ring:My chastity's the jewel of our house,Bequeathed down from many ancestors;Which were the greatest obloquy i' the worldIn me to lose: thus your own proper wisdomBrings in the champion Honour on my part,Against your vain assault.
BERTRAM
Here, take my ring:My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,And I'll be bid by thee.
DIANA
When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:My reasons are most strong; and you shall know themWhen back again this ring shall be deliver'd:And on your finger in the night I'll putAnother ring, that what in time proceedsMay token to the future our past deeds.
Adieu, till then; then, fail not.
You have wonA wife of me, though there my hope be done.
BERTRAM
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
DIANA
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
You may so in the end.
My mother told me just how he would woo,As if she sat in 's heart; she says all menHave the like oaths: he had sworn to marry meWhen his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with himWhen I am buried.
Since Frenchmen are so braid,Marry that will, I live and die a maid:Only in this disguise I think't no sinTo cozen him that would unjustly win.
