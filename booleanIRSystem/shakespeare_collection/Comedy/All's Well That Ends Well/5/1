HELENA
But this exceeding posting day and nightMust wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:But since you have made the days and nights as one,To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,Be bold you do so grow in my requitalAs nothing can unroot you.
In happy time;This man may help me to his majesty's ear,If he would spend his power.
God save you, sir.Gentleman
And you.
HELENA
Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
Gentleman
I have been sometimes there.
HELENA
I do presume, sir, that you are not fallenFrom the report that goes upon your goodness;An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,Which lay nice manners by, I put you toThe use of your own virtues, for the whichI shall continue thankful.
Gentleman
What's your will?
HELENA
That it will please youTo give this poor petition to the king,And aid me with that store of power you haveTo come into his presence.
Gentleman
The king's not here.
HELENA
Not here, sir!
Gentleman
Not, indeed:He hence removed last night and with more hasteThan is his use.
Widow

HELENA
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
Gentleman
Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;Whither I am going.
HELENA
I do beseech you, sir,Since you are like to see the king before me,Commend the paper to his gracious hand,Which I presume shall render you no blameBut rather make you thank your pains for it.
I will come after you with what good speedOur means will make us means.
Gentleman
This I'll do for you.
HELENA
And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,Whate'er falls more.
We must to horse again.Go, go, provide.
