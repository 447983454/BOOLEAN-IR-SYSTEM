Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace.
PAROLLES
Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu thisletter: I have ere now, sir, been better known toyou, when I have held familiarity with fresherclothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune'smood, and smell somewhat strong of her strongdispleasure.
Clown
Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if itsmell so strongly as thou speakest of: I willhenceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
Prithee, allow the wind.
PAROLLES
Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spakebut by a metaphor.
Clown
Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop mynose; or against any man's metaphor.
Prithee, getthee further.
PAROLLES
Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
Clown
Foh!
prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune'sclose-stool to give to a nobleman!
Look, here hecomes himself.
Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune'scat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into theunclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as hesays, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use thecarp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,ingenious, foolish, rascally knave.
I do pity hisdistress in my similes of comfort and leave him toyour lordship.
PAROLLES
My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruellyscratched.
LAFEU
And what would you have me to do?
'Tis too late topare her nails now.
Wherein have you played theknave with fortune, that she should scratch you, whoof herself is a good lady and would not have knavesthrive long under her?
There's a quart d'ecu foryou: let the justices make you and fortune friends:I am for other business.
PAROLLES
I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
LAFEU
You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;save your word.
PAROLLES
My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
LAFEU
You beg more than 'word,' then.
Cox my passion!give me your hand.
How does your drum?PAROLLES
O my good lord, you were the first that found me!
LAFEU
Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.
PAROLLES
It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,for you did bring me out.
LAFEU
Out upon thee, knave!
dost thou put upon me at onceboth the office of God and the devil?
One bringsthee in grace and the other brings thee out.
The king's coming; I know by his trumpets.
Sirrah,inquire further after me; I had talk of you lastnight: though you are a fool and a knave, you shalleat; go to, follow.
PAROLLES
I praise God for you.
