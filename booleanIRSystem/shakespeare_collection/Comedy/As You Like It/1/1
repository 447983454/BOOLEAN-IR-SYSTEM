Orchard of Oliver's house.
ORLANDO
As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashionbequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on hisblessing, to breed me well: and there begins mysadness.
My brother Jaques he keeps at school, andreport speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak moreproperly, stays me here at home unkept; for call youthat keeping for a gentleman of my birth, thatdiffers not from the stalling of an ox?
His horsesare bred better; for, besides that they are fairwith their feeding, they are taught their manage,and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, hisbrother, gain nothing under him but growth; for thewhich his animals on his dunghills are as muchbound to him as I.
Besides this nothing that he soplentifully gives me, the something that nature gaveme his countenance seems to take from me: he letsme feed with his hinds, bars me the place of abrother, and, as much as in him lies, mines mygentility with my education.
This is it, Adam, thatgrieves me; and the spirit of my father, which Ithink is within me, begins to mutiny against thisservitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet Iknow no wise remedy how to avoid it.
ADAM
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
ORLANDO
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he willshake me up.
OLIVER
Now, sir!
what make you here?ORLANDO
Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
OLIVER
What mar you then, sir?
ORLANDO
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which Godmade, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
OLIVER
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
ORLANDO
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
What prodigal portion have I spent, that I shouldcome to such penury?
OLIVER
Know you where your are, sir?
ORLANDO
O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
OLIVER
Know you before whom, sir?
ORLANDO
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
I knowyou are my eldest brother; and, in the gentlecondition of blood, you should so know me.
Thecourtesy of nations allows you my better, in thatyou are the first-born; but the same traditiontakes not away my blood, were there twenty brothersbetwixt us: I have as much of my father in me asyou; albeit, I confess, your coming before me isnearer to his reverence.
OLIVER
What, boy!
ORLANDO
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
OLIVER
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
ORLANDO
I am no villain; I am the youngest son of SirRowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thricea villain that says such a father begot villains.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this handfrom thy throat till this other had pulled out thytongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
ADAM
Sweet masters, be patient: for your father'sremembrance, be at accord.
OLIVER
Let me go, I say.
ORLANDO
I will not, till I please: you shall hear me.
Myfather charged you in his will to give me goodeducation: you have trained me like a peasant,obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-likequalities.
The spirit of my father grows strong inme, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allowme such exercises as may become a gentleman, orgive me the poor allottery my father left me bytestament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
OLIVER
And what wilt thou do?
beg, when that is spent?Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubledwith you; you shall have some part of your will: Ipray you, leave me.
ORLANDO
I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
OLIVER
Get you with him, you old dog.
ADAM
Is 'old dog' my reward?
Most true, I have lost myteeth in your service.
God be with my old master!he would not have spoke such a word.
OLIVER
Is it even so?
begin you to grow upon me? I willphysic your rankness, and yet give no thousandcrowns neither.
Holla, Dennis!DENNIS
Calls your worship?
OLIVER
Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
DENNIS
So please you, he is here at the door and importunesaccess to you.
OLIVER
Call him in.
'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
CHARLES
Good morrow to your worship.
OLIVER
Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at thenew court?
CHARLES
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:that is, the old duke is banished by his youngerbrother the new duke; and three or four loving lordshave put themselves into voluntary exile with him,whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
OLIVER
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, bebanished with her father?
CHARLES
O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so lovesher, being ever from their cradles bred together,that she would have followed her exile, or have diedto stay behind her.
She is at the court, and noless beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; andnever two ladies loved as they do.
OLIVER
Where will the old duke live?
CHARLES
They say he is already in the forest of Arden, anda many merry men with him; and there they live likethe old Robin Hood of England: they say many younggentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the timecarelessly, as they did in the golden world.
OLIVER
What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
CHARLES
Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with amatter.
I am given, sir, secretly to understandthat your younger brother Orlando hath a dispositionto come in disguised against me to try a fall.
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he thatescapes me without some broken limb shall acquit himwell.
Your brother is but young and tender; and,for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as Imust, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint youwithal, that either you might stay him from hisintendment or brook such disgrace well as he shallrun into, in that it is a thing of his own searchand altogether against my will.
OLIVER
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, whichthou shalt find I will most kindly requite.
I hadmyself notice of my brother's purpose herein andhave by underhand means laboured to dissuade him fromit, but he is resolute.
I'll tell thee, Charles:it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, fullof ambition, an envious emulator of every man'sgood parts, a secret and villanous contriver againstme his natural brother: therefore use thydiscretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neckas his finger.
And thou wert best look to't; for ifthou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do notmightily grace himself on thee, he will practiseagainst thee by poison, entrap thee by sometreacherous device and never leave thee till hehath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speakit, there is not one so young and so villanous thisday living.
I speak but brotherly of him; butshould I anatomize him to thee as he is, I mustblush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
CHARLES
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.
If he cometo-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he goalone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: andso God keep your worship!
OLIVER
Farewell, good Charles.
Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall seean end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,hates nothing more than he.
Yet he's gentle, neverschooled and yet learned, full of noble device, ofall sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so muchin the heart of the world, and especially of my ownpeople, who best know him, that I am altogethermisprised: but it shall not be so long; thiswrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but thatI kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.
