The Forest of Arden.
ROSALIND
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
TOUCHSTONE
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
ROSALIND
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man'sapparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfortthe weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to showitself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,good Aliena!
CELIA
I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.
TOUCHSTONE
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bearyou; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,for I think you have no money in your purse.
ROSALIND
Well, this is the forest of Arden.
TOUCHSTONE
Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I wasat home, I was in a better place: but travellersmust be content.
ROSALIND
Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old insolemn talk.
CORIN
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
SILVIUS
O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
CORIN
I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.
SILVIUS
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,Though in thy youth thou wast as true a loverAs ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:But if thy love were ever like to mine--As sure I think did never man love so--How many actions most ridiculousHast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
CORIN
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
SILVIUS
O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
If thou remember'st not the slightest follyThat ever love did make thee run into,Thou hast not loved:Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,Thou hast not loved:Or if thou hast not broke from companyAbruptly, as my passion now makes me,Thou hast not loved.
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!
ROSALIND
Alas, poor shepherd!
searching of thy wound,I have by hard adventure found mine own.
TOUCHSTONE
And I mine.
I remember, when I was in love I brokemy sword upon a stone and bid him take that forcoming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember thekissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that herpretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember thewooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I tooktwo cods and, giving her them again, said withweeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.
' We that aretrue lovers run into strange capers; but as all ismortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
ROSALIND
Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
TOUCHSTONE
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till Ibreak my shins against it.
ROSALIND
Jove, Jove!
this shepherd's passionIs much upon my fashion.
TOUCHSTONE
And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
CELIA
I pray you, one of you question yond manIf he for gold will give us any food:I faint almost to death.
TOUCHSTONE
Holla, you clown!
ROSALIND
Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.
CORIN
Who calls?
TOUCHSTONE
Your betters, sir.
CORIN
Else are they very wretched.
ROSALIND
Peace, I say.
Good even to you, friend.CORIN
And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
ROSALIND
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or goldCan in this desert place buy entertainment,Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'dAnd faints for succor.
CORIN
Fair sir, I pity herAnd wish, for her sake more than for mine own,My fortunes were more able to relieve her;But I am shepherd to another manAnd do not shear the fleeces that I graze:My master is of churlish dispositionAnd little recks to find the way to heavenBy doing deeds of hospitality:Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feedAre now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,By reason of his absence, there is nothingThat you will feed on; but what is, come see.
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
ROSALIND
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
CORIN
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,That little cares for buying any thing.
ROSALIND
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
CELIA
And we will mend thy wages.
I like this place.And willingly could waste my time in it.
CORIN
Assuredly the thing is to be sold:Go with me: if you like upon reportThe soil, the profit and this kind of life,I will your very faithful feeder beAnd buy it with your gold right suddenly.
