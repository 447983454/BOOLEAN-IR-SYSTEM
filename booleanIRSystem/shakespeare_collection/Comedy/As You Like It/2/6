The forest.
ADAM
Dear master, I can go no further.
O, I die for food!Here lie I down, and measure out my grave.
Farewell,kind master.
ORLANDO
Why, how now, Adam!
no greater heart in thee? Livea little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, Iwill either be food for it or bring it for food tothee.
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile atthe arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;and if I bring thee not something to eat, I willgive thee leave to die: but if thou diest before Icome, thou art a mocker of my labour.
Well said!thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bearthee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die forlack of a dinner, if there live any thing in thisdesert.
Cheerly, good Adam!
