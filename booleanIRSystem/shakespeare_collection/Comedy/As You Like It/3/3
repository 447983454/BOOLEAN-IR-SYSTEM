The forest.
TOUCHSTONE
Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up yourgoats, Audrey.
And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?doth my simple feature content you?
AUDREY
Your features!
Lord warrant us! what features!TOUCHSTONE
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the mostcapricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
JAQUES
[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jovein a thatched house!
TOUCHSTONE
When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor aman's good wit seconded with the forward childUnderstanding, it strikes a man more dead than agreat reckoning in a little room.
Truly, I wouldthe gods had made thee poetical.
AUDREY
I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest indeed and word?
is it a true thing?TOUCHSTONE
No, truly; for the truest poetry is the mostfeigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and whatthey swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
AUDREY
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
TOUCHSTONE
I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou arthonest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have somehope thou didst feign.
AUDREY
Would you not have me honest?
TOUCHSTONE
No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; forhonesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
JAQUES
[Aside]  A material fool!
AUDREY
 Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the godsmake me honest.
TOUCHSTONE
Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slutwere to put good meat into an unclean dish.
AUDREY
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
TOUCHSTONE
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
sluttishness may come hereafter.
But be it as it maybe, I will marry thee, and to that end I have beenwith Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the nextvillage, who hath promised to meet me in this placeof the forest and to couple us.
JAQUES
[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
AUDREY
Well, the gods give us joy!
TOUCHSTONE
Amen.
A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,stagger in this attempt; for here we have no templebut the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts.
But whatthough? C ourage!
As horns are odious, they arenecessary.
It is said, 'many a man knows no end ofhis goods:' right; many a man has good horns, andknows no end of them.
Well, that is the dowry ofhis wife; 'tis none of his own getting.
Horns?Even so.
Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deerhath them as huge as the rascal.
Is the single mantherefore blessed?
No: as a walled town is moreworthier than a village, so is the forehead of amarried man more honourable than the bare brow of abachelor; and by how much defence is better than noskill, by so much is a horn more precious than towant.
Here comes Sir Oliver.Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will youdispatch us here under this tree, or shall we gowith you to your chapel?
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
Is there none here to give the woman?
TOUCHSTONE
I will not take her on gift of any man.
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
JAQUES
[Advancing]Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.
TOUCHSTONE
Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,sir?
You are very well met: God 'ild you for yourlast company: I am very glad to see you: even atoy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
JAQUES
Will you be married, motley?
TOUCHSTONE
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb andthe falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; andas pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
JAQUES
And will you, being a man of your breeding, bemarried under a bush like a beggar?
Get you tochurch, and have a good priest that can tell youwhat marriage is: this fellow will but join youtogether as they join wainscot; then one of you willprove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
TOUCHSTONE
[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to bemarried of him than of another: for he is not liketo marry me well; and not being well married, itwill be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
JAQUES
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
TOUCHSTONE
'Come, sweet Audrey:We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--O sweet Oliver,O brave Oliver,Leave me not behind thee: but,--Wind away,Begone, I say,I will not to wedding with thee.
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of themall shall flout me out of my calling.
