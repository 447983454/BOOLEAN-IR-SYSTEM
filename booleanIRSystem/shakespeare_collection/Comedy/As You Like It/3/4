The forest.
ROSALIND
Never talk to me; I will weep.
CELIA
Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to considerthat tears do not become a man.
ROSALIND
But have I not cause to weep?
CELIA
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
ROSALIND
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
CELIA
Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses areJudas's own children.
ROSALIND
I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
CELIA
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
ROSALIND
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touchof holy bread.
CELIA
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nunof winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;the very ice of chastity is in them.
ROSALIND
But why did he swear he would come this morning, andcomes not?
CELIA
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
ROSALIND
Do you think so?
CELIA
Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor ahorse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I dothink him as concave as a covered goblet or aworm-eaten nut.
ROSALIND
Not true in love?
CELIA
Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
ROSALIND
You have heard him swear downright he was.
CELIA
'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover isno stronger than the word of a tapster; they areboth the confirmer of false reckonings.
He attendshere in the forest on the duke your father.
ROSALIND
I met the duke yesterday and had much question withhim: he asked me of what parentage I was; I toldhim, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
But what talk we of fathers, when there is such aman as Orlando?
CELIA
O, that's a brave man!
he writes brave verses,speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaksthem bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart ofhis lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horsebut on one side, breaks his staff like a noblegoose: but all's brave that youth mounts and follyguides.
Who comes here?CORIN
Mistress and master, you have oft inquiredAfter the shepherd that complain'd of love,Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,Praising the proud disdainful shepherdessThat was his mistress.
CELIA
Well, and what of him?
CORIN
If you will see a pageant truly play'd,Between the pale complexion of true loveAnd the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,If you will mark it.
ROSALIND
O, come, let us remove:The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring us to this sight, and you shall sayI'll prove a busy actor in their play.
