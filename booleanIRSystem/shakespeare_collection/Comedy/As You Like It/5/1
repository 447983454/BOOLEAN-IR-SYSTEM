The forest.
TOUCHSTONE
We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
AUDREY
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the oldgentleman's saying.
TOUCHSTONE
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vileMartext.
But, Audrey, there is a youth here in theforest lays claim to you.
AUDREY
Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me inthe world: here comes the man you mean.
TOUCHSTONE
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by mytroth, we that have good wits have much to answerfor; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.
WILLIAM
Good even, Audrey.
AUDREY
God ye good even, William.
WILLIAM
And good even to you, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
Good even, gentle friend.
Cover thy head, cover thyhead; nay, prithee, be covered.
How old are you, friend?WILLIAM
Five and twenty, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
A ripe age.
Is thy name William?WILLIAM
William, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
A fair name.
Wast born i' the forest here?WILLIAM
Ay, sir, I thank God.
TOUCHSTONE
'Thank God;' a good answer.
Art rich?WILLIAM
Faith, sir, so so.
TOUCHSTONE
'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; andyet it is not; it is but so so.
Art thou wise?WILLIAM
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
TOUCHSTONE
Why, thou sayest well.
I do now remember a saying,'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise manknows himself to be a fool.
' The heathenphilosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat andlips to open.
You do love this maid?WILLIAM
I do, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
Give me your hand.
Art thou learned?WILLIAM
No, sir.
TOUCHSTONE
Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for itis a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured outof a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth emptythe other; for all your writers do consent that ipseis he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
WILLIAM
Which he, sir?
TOUCHSTONE
He, sir, that must marry this woman.
Therefore, youclown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--thesociety,--which in the boorish is company,--of thisfemale,--which in the common is woman; whichtogether is, abandon the society of this female, or,clown, thou perishest; or, to thy betterunderstanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, makethee away, translate thy life into death, thyliberty into bondage: I will deal in poison withthee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandywith thee in faction; I will o'errun thee withpolicy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:therefore tremble and depart.
AUDREY
Do, good William.
WILLIAM
God rest you merry, sir.
CORIN
Our master and mistress seeks you; come, away, away!
TOUCHSTONE
Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.
