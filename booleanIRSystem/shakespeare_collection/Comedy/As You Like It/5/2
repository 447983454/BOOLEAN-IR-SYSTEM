The forest.
ORLANDO
Is't possible that on so little acquaintance youshould like her?
that but seeing you should loveher?
and loving woo? and, wooing, she shouldgrant?
and will you persever to enjoy her?OLIVER
Neither call the giddiness of it in question, thepoverty of her, the small acquaintance, my suddenwooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;consent with both that we may enjoy each other: itshall be to your good; for my father's house and allthe revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will Iestate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
ORLANDO
You have my consent.
Let your wedding be to-morrow:thither will I invite the duke and all's contentedfollowers.
Go you and prepare Aliena; for lookyou, here comes my Rosalind.
ROSALIND
God save you, brother.
OLIVER
And you, fair sister.
ROSALIND
O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see theewear thy heart in a scarf!
ORLANDO
It is my arm.
ROSALIND
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the clawsof a lion.
ORLANDO
Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
ROSALIND
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited toswoon when he showed me your handkerchief?
ORLANDO
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
ROSALIND
O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there wasnever any thing so sudden but the fight of two ramsand Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, andovercame:' for your brother and my sister no soonermet but they looked, no sooner looked but theyloved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no soonersighed but they asked one another the reason, nosooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairsto marriage which they will climb incontinent, orelse be incontinent before marriage: they are inthe very wrath of love and they will together; clubscannot part them.
ORLANDO
They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid theduke to the nuptial.
But, O, how bitter a thing itis to look into happiness through another man'seyes!
By so much the more shall I to-morrow be atthe height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shallthink my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
ROSALIND
Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
ORLANDO
I can live no longer by thinking.
ROSALIND
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: Ispeak not this that you should bear a good opinionof my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may insome little measure draw a belief from you, to doyourself good and not to grace me.
Believe then, ifyou please, that I can do strange things: I have,since I was three year old, conversed with amagician, most profound in his art and yet notdamnable.
If you do love Rosalind so near the heartas your gesture cries it out, when your brothermarries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know intowhat straits of fortune she is driven; and it isnot impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenientto you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow humanas she is and without any danger.
ORLANDO
Speakest thou in sober meanings?
ROSALIND
By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though Isay I am a magician.
Therefore, put you in yourbest array: bid your friends; for if you will bemarried to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.
Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.
PHEBE
Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,To show the letter that I writ to you.
ROSALIND
I care not if I have: it is my studyTo seem despiteful and ungentle to you:You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
PHEBE
Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
SILVIUS
It is to be all made of sighs and tears;And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE
And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO
And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND
And I for no woman.
SILVIUS
It is to be all made of faith and service;And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE
And I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO
And I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND
And I for no woman.
SILVIUS
It is to be all made of fantasy,All made of passion and all made of wishes,All adoration, duty, and observance,All humbleness, all patience and impatience,All purity, all trial, all observance;And so am I for Phebe.
PHEBE
And so am I for Ganymede.
ORLANDO
And so am I for Rosalind.
ROSALIND
And so am I for no woman.
PHEBE
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
SILVIUS
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ORLANDO
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ROSALIND
Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?
'ORLANDO
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
ROSALIND
Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howlingof Irish wolves against the moon.
I will help you, if I can:I would love you, if I could.
To-morrow meet me all together.I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll bemarried to-morrow:I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and youshall be married to-morrow:I will content you, if what pleases you contentsyou, and you shall be married to-morrow.
As you love Rosalind, meet:as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,I'll meet.
So fare you well: I have left you commands.SILVIUS
I'll not fail, if I live.
PHEBE
Nor I.
ORLANDO
Nor I.
