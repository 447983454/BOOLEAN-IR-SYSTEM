Before LEONATO'S house.
LEONATO
I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragoncomes this night to Messina.
Messenger
He is very near by this: he was not three leagues offwhen I left him.
LEONATO
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
Messenger
But few of any sort, and none of name.
LEONATO
A victory is twice itself when the achiever bringshome full numbers.
I find here that Don Peter hathbestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
Messenger
Much deserved on his part and equally remembered byDon Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond thepromise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,the feats of a lion: he hath indeed betterbettered expectation than you must expect of me totell you how.
LEONATO
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very muchglad of it.
Messenger
I have already delivered him letters, and thereappears much joy in him; even so much that joy couldnot show itself modest enough without a badge ofbitterness.
LEONATO
Did he break out into tears?
Messenger
In great measure.
LEONATO
A kind overflow of kindness: there are no facestruer than those that are so washed.
How muchbetter is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
BEATRICE
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from thewars or no?
Messenger
I know none of that name, lady: there was none suchin the army of any sort.
LEONATO
What is he that you ask for, niece?
HERO
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Messenger
O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
BEATRICE
He set up his bills here in Messina and challengedCupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, readingthe challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challengedhim at the bird-bolt.
I pray you, how many hath hekilled and eaten in these wars?
But how many hathhe killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
LEONATO
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
Messenger
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
BEATRICE
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath anexcellent stomach.
Messenger
And a good soldier too, lady.
BEATRICE
And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
Messenger
A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with allhonourable virtues.
BEATRICE
It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
LEONATO
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.
There is akind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:they never meet but there's a skirmish of witbetween them.
BEATRICE
Alas! he gets nothing by that.
In our lastconflict four of his five wits went halting off, andnow is the whole man governed with one: so that ifhe have wit enough to keep himself warm, let himbear it for a difference between himself and hishorse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,to be known a reasonable creature.
Who is hiscompanion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
Messenger
Is't possible?
BEATRICE
Very easily possible: he wears his faith but asthe fashion of his hat; it ever changes with thenext block.
Messenger
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
BEATRICE
No; an he were, I would burn my study.
But, I prayyou, who is his companion?
Is there no youngsquarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
Messenger
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
BEATRICE
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: heis sooner caught than the pestilence, and the takerruns presently mad.
God help the noble Claudio! ifhe have caught the Benedick, it will cost him athousand pound ere a' be cured.
Messenger
I will hold friends with you, lady.
BEATRICE
Do, good friend.
LEONATO
You will never run mad, niece.
BEATRICE
No, not till a hot January.
Messenger
Don Pedro is approached.
DON PEDRO
Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet yourtrouble: the fashion of the world is to avoidcost, and you encounter it.
LEONATO
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness ofyour grace: for trouble being gone, comfort shouldremain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abidesand happiness takes his leave.
DON PEDRO
You embrace your charge too willingly.
I think thisis your daughter.
LEONATO
Her mother hath many times told me so.
BENEDICK
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
LEONATO
Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
DON PEDRO
You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by thiswhat you are, being a man.
Truly, the lady fathersherself.
Be happy, lady; for you are like anhonourable father.
BENEDICK
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would nothave his head on her shoulders for all Messina, aslike him as she is.
BEATRICE
I wonder that you will still be talking, SigniorBenedick: nobody marks you.
BENEDICK
What, my dear Lady Disdain!
are you yet living?BEATRICE
Is it possible disdain should die while she hathsuch meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you comein her presence.
BENEDICK
Then is courtesy a turncoat.
But it is certain Iam loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and Iwould I could find in my heart that I had not a hardheart; for, truly, I love none.
BEATRICE
A dear happiness to women: they would else havebeen troubled with a pernicious suitor.
I thank Godand my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: Ihad rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a manswear he loves me.
BENEDICK
God keep your ladyship still in that mind!
so somegentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinatescratched face.
BEATRICE
Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere sucha face as yours were.
BENEDICK
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
BEATRICE
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
BENEDICK
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, andso good a continuer.
But keep your way, i' God'sname; I have done.
BEATRICE
You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
DON PEDRO
That is the sum of all, Leonato.
Signior Claudioand Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hathinvited you all.
I tell him we shall stay here atthe least a month; and he heartily prays someoccasion may detain us longer.
I dare swear he is nohypocrite, but prays from his heart.
LEONATO
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled tothe prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
DON JOHN
I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thankyou.
LEONATO
Please it your grace lead on?
DON PEDRO
Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
CLAUDIO
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
BENEDICK
I noted her not; but I looked on her.
CLAUDIO
Is she not a modest young lady?
BENEDICK
Do you question me, as an honest man should do, formy simple true judgment; or would you have me speakafter my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
CLAUDIO
No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
BENEDICK
Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a highpraise, too brown for a fair praise and too littlefor a great praise: only this commendation I canafford her, that were she other than she is, shewere unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, Ido not like her.
CLAUDIO
Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell metruly how thou likest her.
BENEDICK
Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
CLAUDIO
Can the world buy such a jewel?
BENEDICK
Yea, and a case to put it into.
But speak you thiswith a sad brow?
or do you play the flouting Jack,to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan arare carpenter?
Come, in what key shall a man takeyou, to go in the song?
CLAUDIO
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever Ilooked on.
BENEDICK
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no suchmatter: there's her cousin, an she were notpossessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beautyas the first of May doth the last of December.
But Ihope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
CLAUDIO
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn thecontrary, if Hero would be my wife.
BENEDICK
Is't come to this?
In faith, hath not the worldone man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neckinto a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh awaySundays.
Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.DON PEDRO
What secret hath held you here, that you followednot to Leonato's?
BENEDICK
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
DON PEDRO
I charge thee on thy allegiance.
BENEDICK
You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumbman; I would have you think so; but, on myallegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance.
He isin love.
With who? now that is your grace's part.Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato'sshort daughter.
CLAUDIO
If this were so, so were it uttered.
BENEDICK
Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should beso.
'CLAUDIO
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid itshould be otherwise.
DON PEDRO
Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
CLAUDIO
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
DON PEDRO
By my troth, I speak my thought.
CLAUDIO
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
BENEDICK
And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
CLAUDIO
That I love her, I feel.
DON PEDRO
That she is worthy, I know.
BENEDICK
That I neither feel how she should be loved norknow how she should be worthy, is the opinion thatfire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
DON PEDRO
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despiteof beauty.
CLAUDIO
And never could maintain his part but in the forceof his will.
BENEDICK
That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that shebrought me up, I likewise give her most humblethanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in myforehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,all women shall pardon me.
Because I will not dothem the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself theright to trust none; and the fine is, for the whichI may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
DON PEDRO
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
BENEDICK
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,not with love: prove that ever I lose more bloodwith love than I will get again with drinking, pickout mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang meup at the door of a brothel-house for the sign ofblind Cupid.
DON PEDRO
Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thouwilt prove a notable argument.
BENEDICK
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shootat me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped onthe shoulder, and called Adam.
DON PEDRO
Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bulldoth bear the yoke.
'BENEDICK
The savage bull may; but if ever the sensibleBenedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and setthem in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,and in such great letters as they write 'Here isgood horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign'Here you may see Benedick the married man.
'CLAUDIO
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
DON PEDRO
Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver inVenice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
BENEDICK
I look for an earthquake too, then.
DON PEDRO
Well, you temporize with the hours.
In themeantime, good Signior Benedick, repair toLeonato's: commend me to him and tell him I willnot fail him at supper; for indeed he hath madegreat preparation.
BENEDICK
I have almost matter enough in me for such anembassage; and so I commit you--CLAUDIO
To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--DON PEDRO
The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.
BENEDICK
Nay, mock not, mock not.
The body of yourdiscourse is sometime guarded with fragments, andthe guards are but slightly basted on neither: ereyou flout old ends any further, examine yourconscience: and so I leave you.
CLAUDIO
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
DON PEDRO
My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,And thou shalt see how apt it is to learnAny hard lesson that may do thee good.
CLAUDIO
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
DON PEDRO
No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
CLAUDIO
O, my lord,When you went onward on this ended action,I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,That liked, but had a rougher task in handThan to drive liking to the name of love:But now I am return'd and that war-thoughtsHave left their places vacant, in their roomsCome thronging soft and delicate desires,All prompting me how fair young Hero is,Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
DON PEDRO
Thou wilt be like a lover presentlyAnd tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,And I will break with her and with her father,And thou shalt have her.
Was't not to this endThat thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
CLAUDIO
How sweetly you do minister to love,That know love's grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
DON PEDRO
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,And I will fit thee with the remedy.
I know we shall have revelling to-night:I will assume thy part in some disguiseAnd tell fair Hero I am Claudio,And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heartAnd take her hearing prisoner with the forceAnd strong encounter of my amorous tale:Then after to her father will I break;And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practise let us put it presently.
