The same. A room in the brothel.
Pandar
Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her shehad ne'er come here.
Bawd
Fie, fie upon her!
she's able to freeze the godPriapus, and undo a whole generation.
We musteither get her ravished, or be rid of her.
When sheshould do for clients her fitment, and do me thekindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, herknees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,if he should cheapen a kiss of her.
BOULT
'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish usof all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.
Pandar
Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!
Bawd
'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by theway to the pox.
Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.BOULT
We should have both lord and lown, if the peevishbaggage would but give way to customers.
LYSIMACHUS
How now!
How a dozen of virginities?Bawd
Now, the gods to-bless your honour!
BOULT
I am glad to see your honour in good health.
LYSIMACHUS
You may so; 'tis the better for you that yourresorters stand upon sound legs.
How now!wholesome iniquity have you that a man may dealwithal, and defy the surgeon?
Bawd
We have here one, sir, if she would--but there nevercame her like in Mytilene.
LYSIMACHUS
If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.
Bawd
Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.
LYSIMACHUS
Well, call forth, call forth.
BOULT
For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shallsee a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--LYSIMACHUS
What, prithee?
BOULT
O, sir, I can be modest.
LYSIMACHUS
That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than itgives a good report to a number to be chaste.
Bawd
Here comes that which grows to the stalk; neverplucked yet, I can assure you.
Is she not a fair creature?
LYSIMACHUS
'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.
Well, there's for you: leave us.
Bawd
I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, andI'll have done presently.
LYSIMACHUS
I beseech you, do.
Bawd
[To MARINA]  First, I would have you note, this isan honourable man.
MARINA
I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.
Bawd
Next, he's the governor of this country, and a manwhom I am bound to.
MARINA
If he govern the country, you are bound to himindeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.
Bawd
Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, willyou use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.
MARINA
What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.
LYSIMACHUS
Ha' you done?
Bawd
My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take somepains to work her to your manage.
Come, we willleave his honour and her together.
Go thy ways.LYSIMACHUS
Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?
MARINA
What trade, sir?
LYSIMACHUS
Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.
MARINA
I cannot be offended with my trade.
Please you to name it.LYSIMACHUS
How long have you been of this profession?
MARINA
E'er since I can remember.
LYSIMACHUS
Did you go to 't so young?
Were you a gamester atfive or at seven?
MARINA
Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
LYSIMACHUS
Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be acreature of sale.
MARINA
Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,and will come into 't?
I hear say you are ofhonourable parts, and are the governor of this place.
LYSIMACHUS
Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?
MARINA
Who is my principal?
LYSIMACHUS
Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and rootsof shame and iniquity.
O, you have heard somethingof my power, and so stand aloof for more seriouswooing.
But I protest to thee, pretty one, myauthority shall not see thee, or else look friendlyupon thee.
Come, bring me to some private place:come, come.
MARINA
If you were born to honour, show it now;If put upon you, make the judgment goodThat thought you worthy of it.
LYSIMACHUS
How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.
MARINA
For me,That am a maid, though most ungentle fortuneHave placed me in this sty, where, since I came,Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,O, that the godsWould set me free from this unhallow'd place,Though they did change me to the meanest birdThat flies i' the purer air!
LYSIMACHUS
I did not thinkThou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,Thy speech had alter'd it.
Hold, here's gold for thee:Persever in that clear way thou goest,And the gods strengthen thee!
MARINA
The good gods preserve you!
LYSIMACHUS
For me, be you thoughtenThat I came with no ill intent; for to meThe very doors and windows savour vilely.
Fare thee well.
Thou art a piece of virtue, andI doubt not but thy training hath been noble.
Hold, here's more gold for thee.
A curse upon him, die he like a thief,That robs thee of thy goodness!
If thou dostHear from me, it shall be for thy good.
BOULT
I beseech your honour, one piece for me.
LYSIMACHUS
Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!
Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,Would sink and overwhelm you.
Away!BOULT
How's this? We must take another course with you.
If your peevish chastity, which is not worth abreakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded likea spaniel.
Come your ways.MARINA
Whither would you have me?
BOULT
I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the commonhangman shall execute it.
Come your ways. We'llhave no more gentlemen driven away.
Come your ways, I say.Bawd
How now!
what's the matter?BOULT
Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holywords to the Lord Lysimachus.
Bawd
O abominable!
BOULT
She makes our profession as it were to stink aforethe face of the gods.
Bawd
Marry, hang her up for ever!
BOULT
The nobleman would have dealt with her like anobleman, and she sent him away as cold as asnowball; saying his prayers too.
Bawd
Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.
BOULT
An if she were a thornier piece of ground than sheis, she shall be ploughed.
MARINA
Hark, hark, you gods!
Bawd
She conjures: away with her!
Would she had nevercome within my doors!
Marry, hang you! She's bornto undo us.
Will you not go the way of women-kind?Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!
BOULT
Come, mistress; come your ways with me.
MARINA
Whither wilt thou have me?
BOULT
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
MARINA
Prithee, tell me one thing first.
BOULT
Come now, your one thing.
MARINA
What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
BOULT
Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.
MARINA
Neither of these are so bad as thou art,Since they do better thee in their command.
Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiendOf hell would not in reputation change:Thou art the damned doorkeeper to everyCoistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;To the choleric fisting of every rogueThy ear is liable; thy food is suchAs hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
BOULT
What would you have me do?
go to the wars, wouldyou?
where a man may serve seven years for the lossof a leg, and have not money enough in the end tobuy him a wooden one?
MARINA
Do any thing but this thou doest.
EmptyOLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;Serve by indenture to the common hangman:Any of these ways are yet better than this;For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,Would own a name too dear.
O, that the godsWould safely deliver me from this place!
Here, here's gold for thee.
If that thy master would gain by thee,Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:And I will undertake all these to teach.
I doubt not but this populous city willYield many scholars.
BOULT
But can you teach all this you speak of?
MARINA
Prove that I cannot, take me home again,And prostitute me to the basest groomThat doth frequent your house.
BOULT
Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I canplace thee, I will.
MARINA
But amongst honest women.
BOULT
'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.
But since my master and mistress have bought you,there's no going but by their consent: therefore Iwill make them acquainted with your purpose, and Idoubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.
Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.
GOWER
Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chancesInto an honest house, our story says.
She sings like one immortal, and she dancesAs goddess-like to her admired lays;Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composesNature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,That even her art sisters the natural roses;Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:That pupils lacks she none of noble race,Who pour their bounty on her; and her gainShe gives the cursed bawd.
Here we her place;And to her father turn our thoughts again,Where we left him, on the sea.
We there him lost;Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrivedHere where his daughter dwells; and on this coastSuppose him now at anchor.
The city strivedGod Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whenceLysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
In your supposing once more put your sightOf heavy Pericles; think this his bark:Where what is done in action, more, if might,Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
