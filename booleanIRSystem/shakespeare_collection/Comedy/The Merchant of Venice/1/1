Venice. A street.
ANTONIO
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:It wearies me; you say it wearies you;But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,I am to learn;And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,That I have much ado to know myself.
SALARINO
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;There, where your argosies with portly sail,Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,Do overpeer the petty traffickers,That curtsy to them, do them reverence,As they fly by them with their woven wings.
SALANIO
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,The better part of my affections wouldBe with my hopes abroad.
I should be stillPlucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;And every object that might make me fearMisfortune to my ventures, out of doubtWould make me sad.
SALARINO
                  My wind cooling my brothWould blow me to an ague, when I thoughtWhat harm a wind too great at sea might do.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,But I should think of shallows and of flats,And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,Vailing her high-top lower than her ribsTo kiss her burial.
Should I go to churchAnd see the holy edifice of stone,And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,Would scatter all her spices on the stream,Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,And, in a word, but even now worth this,And now worth nothing?
Shall I have the thoughtTo think on this, and shall I lack the thoughtThat such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know, AntonioIs sad to think upon his merchandise.
ANTONIO
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,Nor to one place; nor is my whole estateUpon the fortune of this present year:Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
SALARINO
Why, then you are in love.
ANTONIO
Fie, fie!
SALARINO
Not in love neither?
Then let us say you are sad,Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easyFor you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,Because you are not sad.
Now, by two-headed Janus,Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:Some that will evermore peep through their eyesAnd laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,And other of such vinegar aspectThat they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
SALANIO
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,Gratiano and Lorenzo.
Fare ye well:We leave you now with better company.
SALARINO
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,If worthier friends had not prevented me.
ANTONIO
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it, your own business calls on youAnd you embrace the occasion to depart.
SALARINO
Good morrow, my good lords.
BASSANIO
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh?
say, when?You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
SALARINO
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
LORENZO
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
BASSANIO
I will not fail you.
GRATIANO
You look not well, Signior Antonio;You have too much respect upon the world:They lose it that do buy it with much care:Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
ANTONIO
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;A stage where every man must play a part,And mine a sad one.
GRATIANO
Let me play the fool:With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,And let my liver rather heat with wineThan my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundiceBy being peevish?
I tell thee what, Antonio--I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--There are a sort of men whose visagesDo cream and mantle like a standing pond,And do a wilful stillness entertain,With purpose to be dress'd in an opinionOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!
'O my Antonio, I do know of theseThat therefore only are reputed wiseFor saying nothing; when, I am very sure,If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time:But fish not, with this melancholy bait,For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
Come, good Lorenzo.
Fare ye well awhile:I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
LORENZO
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:I must be one of these same dumb wise men,For Gratiano never lets me speak.
GRATIANO
Well, keep me company but two years moe,Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
ANTONIO
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
GRATIANO
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendableIn a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
ANTONIO
Is that any thing now?
BASSANIO
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, morethan any man in all Venice.
His reasons are as twograins of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: youshall seek all day ere you find them, and when youhave them, they are not worth the search.
ANTONIO
Well, tell me now what lady is the sameTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,That you to-day promised to tell me of?
BASSANIO
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,How much I have disabled mine estate,By something showing a more swelling portThan my faint means would grant continuance:Nor do I now make moan to be abridgedFrom such a noble rate; but my chief careIs to come fairly off from the great debtsWherein my time something too prodigalHath left me gaged.
To you, Antonio,I owe the most, in money and in love,And from your love I have a warrantyTo unburden all my plots and purposesHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.
ANTONIO
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;And if it stand, as you yourself still do,Within the eye of honour, be assured,My purse, my person, my extremest means,Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
BASSANIO
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,I shot his fellow of the self-same flightThe self-same way with more advised watch,To find the other forth, and by adventuring bothI oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,That which I owe is lost; but if you pleaseTo shoot another arrow that self wayWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,As I will watch the aim, or to find bothOr bring your latter hazard back againAnd thankfully rest debtor for the first.
ANTONIO
You know me well, and herein spend but timeTo wind about my love with circumstance;And out of doubt you do me now more wrongIn making question of my uttermostThan if you had made waste of all I have:Then do but say to me what I should doThat in your knowledge may by me be done,And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
BASSANIO
In Belmont is a lady richly left;And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyesI did receive fair speechless messages:Her name is Portia, nothing undervaluedTo Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,For the four winds blow in from every coastRenowned suitors, and her sunny locksHang on her temples like a golden fleece;Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the meansTo hold a rival place with one of them,I have a mind presages me such thrift,That I should questionless be fortunate!
ANTONIO
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;Neither have I money nor commodityTo raise a present sum: therefore go forth;Try what my credit can in Venice do:That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,Where money is, and I no question makeTo have it of my trust or for my sake.
