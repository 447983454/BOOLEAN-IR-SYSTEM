The same. A street.
LORENZO
Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,Disguise us at my lodging and return,All in an hour.
GRATIANO
We have not made good preparation.
SALARINO
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
SALANIO
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,And better in my mind not undertook.
LORENZO
'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hoursTo furnish us.
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
LAUNCELOT
An it shall please you to break upthis, it shall seem to signify.
LORENZO

GRATIANO
Love-news, in faith.
LAUNCELOT

SALANIO

SALANIO

LORENZO
                  Meet me and GratianoAt Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
SALARINO
'Tis good we do so.

If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:And never dare misfortune cross her foot,Unless she do it under this excuse,That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.
