I'll hold. This isthe third time; I hope good luck lies in oddnumbers.

Be you in thePark about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shallsee wonders.
FORD
Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told meyou had appointed?
FALSTAFF
I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poorold man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like apoor old woman.
That same knave Ford, her husband,hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy.
I will tellyou: he beat me grievously, in the shape of awoman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fearnot Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I knowalso life is a shuttle.
I am in haste; go alongwith me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook.
Since Iplucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knewnot what 'twas to be beaten till lately.
Followme: I'll tell you strange things of this knaveFord, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and Iwill deliver his wife into your hand.
Follow.Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.
