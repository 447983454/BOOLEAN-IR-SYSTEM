Another part of the Park.
FALSTAFF
The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minutedraws on.
Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; loveset on thy horns.
O powerful love! that, in somerespects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a mana beast.
You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the loveof Leda.
O omnipotent Love! how near the god drewto the complexion of a goose!
A fault done first inthe form of a beast.
O Jove, a beastly fault! Andthen another fault in the semblance of a fowl; thinkon 't, Jove; a foul fault!
When gods have hotbacks, what shall poor men do?
For me, I am here aWindsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' theforest.
Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who canblame me to piss my tallow?
Who comes here? mydoe?
MISTRESS FORD
Sir John!
art thou there, my deer? my male deer?FALSTAFF
My doe with the black scut!
Let the sky rainpotatoes; let it thunder to the tune of GreenSleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; letthere come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.
MISTRESS FORD
Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.
FALSTAFF
Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I willkeep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellowof this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.
Am I a woodman, ha?
Speak I like Herne the hunter?Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makesrestitution.
As I am a true spirit, welcome!MISTRESS PAGE
Alas, what noise?
MISTRESS FORD
Heaven forgive our sinsFALSTAFF
What should this be?
MISTRESS FORD
MISTRESS PAGE
Away, away!
FALSTAFF
I think the devil will not have me damned, lest theoil that's in me should set hell on fire; he wouldnever else cross me thus.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,You moonshine revellers and shades of night,You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.
PISTOL
Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.
FALSTAFF
They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.
SIR HUGH EVANS
Where's Bede?
Go you, and where you find a maidThat, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,Raise up the organs of her fantasy;Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:But those as sleep and think not on their sins,Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
About, about;Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:That it may stand till the perpetual doom,In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scourWith juice of balm and every precious flower:Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:The expressure that it bears, green let it be,More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' writeIn emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,Our dance of custom round about the oakOf Herne the hunter, let us not forget.
SIR HUGH EVANS
Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order setAnd twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,To guide our measure round about the tree.
But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.
FALSTAFF
Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest hetransform me to a piece of cheese!
PISTOL
Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:If he be chaste, the flame will back descendAnd turn him to no pain; but if he start,It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.
PISTOL
A trial, come.
SIR HUGH EVANS
Come, will this wood take fire?
FALSTAFF
Oh, Oh, Oh!
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
SONG.
Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire,Kindled with unchaste desire,Fed in heart, whose flames aspireAs thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;Pinch him for his villany;Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.
PAGE
Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you nowWill none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?
MISTRESS PAGE
I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higherNow, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband?
do not these fair yokesBecome the forest better than the town?
FORD
Now, sir, who's a cuckold now?
Master Brook,Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are hishorns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hathenjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, hiscudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must bepaid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested forit, Master Brook.
MISTRESS FORD
Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
I will never take you for my love again; but I willalways count you my deer.
FALSTAFF
I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
FORD
Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.
FALSTAFF
And these are not fairies?
I was three or fourtimes in the thought they were not fairies: and yetthe guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of mypowers, drove the grossness of the foppery into areceived belief, in despite of the teeth of allrhyme and reason, that they were fairies.
See nowhow wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis uponill employment!
SIR HUGH EVANS
Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave yourdesires, and fairies will not pinse you.
FORD
Well said, fairy Hugh.
SIR HUGH EVANS
And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.
FORD
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou artable to woo her in good English.
FALSTAFF
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, thatit wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching asthis?
Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall Ihave a coxcomb of frize?
'Tis time I were chokedwith a piece of toasted cheese.
SIR HUGH EVANS
Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.
FALSTAFF
'Seese' and 'putter'!
have I lived to stand at thetaunt of one that makes fritters of English?
Thisis enough to be the decay of lust and late-walkingthrough the realm.
MISTRESS PAGE
Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have thevirtue out of our hearts by the head and shouldersand have given ourselves without scruple to hell,that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
FORD
What, a hodge-pudding?
a bag of flax?MISTRESS PAGE
A puffed man?
PAGE
Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?
FORD
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
PAGE
And as poor as Job?
FORD
And as wicked as his wife?
SIR HUGH EVANS
And given to fornications, and to taverns and sackand wine and metheglins, and to drinkings andswearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
FALSTAFF
Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; Iam dejected; I am not able to answer the Welshflannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: useme as you will.
FORD
Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to oneMaster Brook, that you have cozened of money, towhom you should have been a pander: over and abovethat you have suffered, I think to repay that moneywill be a biting affliction.
PAGE
Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a possetto-night at my house; where I will desire thee tolaugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell herMaster Slender hath married her daughter.
MISTRESS PAGE
[Aside]  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be mydaughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.
SLENDER
Whoa ho!
ho, father Page!PAGE
Son, how now!
how now, son! have you dispatched?SLENDER
Dispatched!
I'll make the best in Gloucestershireknow on't; would I were hanged, la, else.
PAGE
Of what, son?
SLENDER
I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,and she's a great lubberly boy.
If it had not beeni' the church, I would have swinged him, or heshould have swinged me.
If I did not think it hadbeen Anne Page, would I might never stir!
--and 'tisa postmaster's boy.
PAGE
Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
SLENDER
What need you tell me that?
I think so, when I tooka boy for a girl.
If I had been married to him, forall he was in woman's apparel, I would not have hadhim.
PAGE
Why, this is your own folly.
Did not I tell you howyou should know my daughter by her garments?
SLENDER
I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and shecried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yetit was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
MISTRESS PAGE
Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she isnow with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.
DOCTOR CAIUS
Vere is Mistress Page?
By gar, I am cozened: I ha'married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.
MISTRESS PAGE
Why, did you take her in green?
DOCTOR CAIUS
Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.
FORD
This is strange.
Who hath got the right Anne?PAGE
My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.
How now, Master Fenton!
ANNE PAGE
Pardon, good father!
good my mother, pardon!PAGE
Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?
MISTRESS PAGE
Why went you not with master doctor, maid?
FENTON
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
The offence is holy that she hath committed;And this deceit loses the name of craft,Of disobedience, or unduteous title,Since therein she doth evitate and shunA thousand irreligious cursed hours,Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
FORD
Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.
FALSTAFF
I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand tostrike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.
PAGE
Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.
FALSTAFF
When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.
MISTRESS PAGE
Well, I will muse no further.
Master Fenton,Heaven give you many, many merry days!
Good husband, let us every one go home,And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;Sir John and all.
FORD
Let it be so.
Sir John,To Master Brook you yet shall hold your wordFor he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
