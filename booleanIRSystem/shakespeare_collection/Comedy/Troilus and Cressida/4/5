The Grecian camp. Lists set out.
AGAMEMNON
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,Anticipating time with starting courage.
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled airMay pierce the head of the great combatantAnd hale him hither.
AJAX
Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheekOutswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;Thou blow'st for Hector.
ULYSSES
No trumpet answers.
ACHILLES
'Tis but early days.
AGAMEMNON
Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
ULYSSES
'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;He rises on the toe: that spirit of hisIn aspiration lifts him from the earth.
AGAMEMNON
Is this the Lady Cressid?
DIOMEDES
Even she.
AGAMEMNON
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
NESTOR
Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
ULYSSES
Yet is the kindness but particular;'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
NESTOR
And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
So much for Nestor.
ACHILLES
I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:Achilles bids you welcome.
MENELAUS
I had good argument for kissing once.
PATROCLUS
But that's no argument for kissing now;For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,And parted thus you and your argument.
ULYSSES
O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
PATROCLUS
The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:Patroclus kisses you.
MENELAUS
O, this is trim!
PATROCLUS
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
MENELAUS
I'll have my kiss, sir.
Lady, by your leave.CRESSIDA
In kissing, do you render or receive?
PATROCLUS
Both take and give.
CRESSIDA
I'll make my match to live,The kiss you take is better than you give;Therefore no kiss.
MENELAUS
I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.
CRESSIDA
You're an odd man; give even or give none.
MENELAUS
An odd man, lady! every man is odd.
CRESSIDA
No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,That you are odd, and he is even with you.
MENELAUS
You fillip me o' the head.
CRESSIDA
No, I'll be sworn.
ULYSSES
It were no match, your nail against his horn.
May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
CRESSIDA
You may.
ULYSSES
I do desire it.
CRESSIDA
Why, beg, then.
ULYSSES
Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,When Helen is a maid again, and his.
CRESSIDA
I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.
ULYSSES
Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
DIOMEDES
Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
NESTOR
A woman of quick sense.
ULYSSES
Fie, fie upon her!
There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look outAt every joint and motive of her body.
O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,That give accosting welcome ere it comes,And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughtsTo every ticklish reader!
set them downFor sluttish spoils of opportunityAnd daughters of the game.
ALL
The Trojans' trumpet.
AGAMEMNON
Yonder comes the troop.
AENEAS
Hail, all you state of Greece!
what shall be doneTo him that victory commands?
or do you purposeA victor shall be known?
will you the knightsShall to the edge of all extremityPursue each other, or shall be dividedBy any voice or order of the field?
Hector bade ask.
AGAMEMNON
Which way would Hector have it?
AENEAS
He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
ACHILLES
'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,A little proudly, and great deal misprizingThe knight opposed.
AENEAS
If not Achilles, sir,What is your name?
ACHILLES
If not Achilles, nothing.
AENEAS
Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:In the extremity of great and little,Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;The one almost as infinite as all,The other blank as nothing.
Weigh him well,And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seekThis blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
ACHILLES
A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.
AGAMEMNON
Here is Sir Diomed.
Go, gentle knight,Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneasConsent upon the order of their fight,So be it; either to the uttermost,Or else a breath: the combatants being kinHalf stints their strife before their strokes begin.
ULYSSES
They are opposed already.
AGAMEMNON
What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
ULYSSES
The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:His heart and hand both open and both free;For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribesTo tender objects, but he in heat of actionIs more vindicative than jealous love:They call him Troilus, and on him erectA second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youthEven to his inches, and with private soulDid in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
AGAMEMNON
They are in action.
NESTOR
Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
TROILUS
Hector, thou sleep'st;Awake thee!
AGAMEMNON
His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!
DIOMEDES
You must no more.
AENEAS
Princes, enough, so please you.
AJAX
I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
DIOMEDES
As Hector pleases.
HECTOR
                  Why, then will I no more:Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;The obligation of our blood forbidsA gory emulation 'twixt us twain:Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan soThat thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,And this is Trojan; the sinews of this legAll Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's bloodRuns on the dexter cheek, and this sinisterBounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish memberWherein my sword had not impressure madeOf our rank feud: but the just gods gainsayThat any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,My sacred aunt, should by my mortal swordBe drain'd!
Let me embrace thee, Ajax:By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;Hector would have them fall upon him thus:Cousin, all honour to thee!
AJAX
I thank thee, HectorThou art too gentle and too free a man:I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear henceA great addition earned in thy death.
HECTOR
Not Neoptolemus so mirable,On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st OyesCries 'This is he,' could promise to himselfA thought of added honour torn from Hector.
AENEAS
There is expectance here from both the sides,What further you will do.
HECTOR
We'll answer it;The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
AJAX
If I might in entreaties find success--As seld I have the chance--I would desireMy famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
DIOMEDES
'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great AchillesDoth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
HECTOR
AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,And signify this loving interviewTo the expecters of our Trojan part;Desire them home.
Give me thy hand, my cousin;I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
AJAX
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
HECTOR
The worthiest of them tell me name by name;But for Achilles, mine own searching eyesShall find him by his large and portly size.
AGAMEMNON
Worthy of arms!
as welcome as to oneThat would be rid of such an enemy;But that's no welcome: understand more clear,What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husksAnd formless ruin of oblivion;But in this extant moment, faith and troth,Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,Bids thee, with most divine integrity,From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
HECTOR
I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
AGAMEMNON
[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy, noless to you.
MENELAUS
Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
HECTOR
Who must we answer?
AENEAS
The noble Menelaus.
HECTOR
O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
MENELAUS
Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
HECTOR
O, pardon; I offend.
NESTOR
I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oftLabouring for destiny make cruel wayThrough ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,Despising many forfeits and subduements,When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,Not letting it decline on the declined,That I have said to some my standers by'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!
'And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,I never saw till now.
I knew thy grandsire,And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,Never saw like thee.
Let an old man embrace thee;And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
AENEAS
'Tis the old Nestor.
HECTOR
Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
NESTOR
I would my arms could match thee in contention,As they contend with thee in courtesy.
HECTOR
I would they could.
NESTOR
Ha!
By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.
Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
ULYSSES
I wonder now how yonder city standsWhen we have here her base and pillar by us.
HECTOR
I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,Since first I saw yourself and DiomedIn Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
ULYSSES
Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:My prophecy is but half his journey yet;For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,Must kiss their own feet.
HECTOR
I must not believe you:There they stand yet, and modestly I think,The fall of every Phrygian stone will costA drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,And that old common arbitrator, Time,Will one day end it.
ULYSSES
So to him we leave it.
Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:After the general, I beseech you nextTo feast with me and see me at my tent.
ACHILLES
I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,And quoted joint by joint.
HECTOR
Is this Achilles?
ACHILLES
I am Achilles.
HECTOR
Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.
ACHILLES
Behold thy fill.
HECTOR
Nay, I have done already.
ACHILLES
Thou art too brief: I will the second time,As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
HECTOR
O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
ACHILLES
Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his bodyShall I destroy him?
whether there, or there, or there?That I may give the local wound a nameAnd make distinct the very breach whereoutHector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!
HECTOR
It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,To answer such a question: stand again:Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantlyAs to prenominate in nice conjectureWhere thou wilt hit me dead?
ACHILLES
I tell thee, yea.
HECTOR
Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,I'd not believe thee.
Henceforth guard thee well;For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;His insolence draws folly from my lips;But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,Or may I never--AJAX
                  Do not chafe thee, cousin:And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,Till accident or purpose bring you to't:You may have every day enough of HectorIf you have stomach; the general state, I fear,Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
HECTOR
I pray you, let us see you in the field:We have had pelting wars, since you refusedThe Grecians' cause.
ACHILLES
Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;To-night all friends.
HECTOR
Thy hand upon that match.
AGAMEMNON
First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;There in the full convive we: afterwards,As Hector's leisure and your bounties shallConcur together, severally entreat him.
Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,That this great soldier may his welcome know.
TROILUS
My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
ULYSSES
At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,But gives all gaze and bent of amorous viewOn the fair Cressid.
TROILUS
Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,After we part from Agamemnon's tent,To bring me thither?
ULYSSES
You shall command me, sir.
As gentle tell me, of what honour wasThis Cressida in Troy?
Had she no lover thereThat wails her absence?
TROILUS
O, sir, to such as boasting show their scarsA mock is due.
Will you walk on, my lord?She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.
