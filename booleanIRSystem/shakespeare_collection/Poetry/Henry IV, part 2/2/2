London. Another street.
PRINCE HENRY
Before God, I am exceeding weary.
POINS
Is't come to that?
I had thought weariness durst nothave attached one of so high blood.
PRINCE HENRY
Faith, it does me; though it discolours thecomplexion of my greatness to acknowledge it.
Dothit not show vilely in me to desire small beer?
POINS
Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied asto remember so weak a composition.
PRINCE HENRY
Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,small beer.
But, indeed, these humbleconsiderations make me out of love with mygreatness.
What a disgrace is it to me to rememberthy name!
or to know thy face to-morrow! or totake note how many pair of silk stockings thouhast, viz.
these, and those that were thypeach-coloured ones!
or to bear the inventory of thyshirts, as, one for superfluity, and another foruse!
But that the tennis-court-keeper knows betterthan I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee whenthou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not donea great while, because the rest of thy lowcountries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruinsof thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but themidwives say the children are not in the fault;whereupon the world increases, and kindreds aremightily strengthened.
POINS
How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,you should talk so idly!
Tell me, how many goodyoung princes would do so, their fathers being sosick as yours at this time is?
PRINCE HENRY
Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
POINS
Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.
PRINCE HENRY
It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
POINS
Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that youwill tell.
PRINCE HENRY
Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should besad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tellthee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of abetter, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sadindeed too.
POINS
Very hardly upon such a subject.
PRINCE HENRY
By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil'sbook as thou and Falstaff for obduracy andpersistency: let the end try the man.
But I tellthee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is sosick: and keeping such vile company as thou arthath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.
POINS
The reason?
PRINCE HENRY
What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?
POINS
I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
PRINCE HENRY
It would be every man's thought; and thou art ablessed fellow to think as every man thinks: nevera man's thought in the world keeps the road-waybetter than thine: every man would think me anhypocrite indeed.
And what accites your mostworshipful thought to think so?
POINS
Why, because you have been so lewd and so muchengraffed to Falstaff.
PRINCE HENRY
And to thee.
POINS
By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear itwith my own ears: the worst that they can say ofme is that I am a second brother and that I am aproper fellow of my hands; and those two things, Iconfess, I cannot help.
By the mass, here comes Bardolph.PRINCE HENRY
And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him fromme Christian; and look, if the fat villain have nottransformed him ape.
BARDOLPH
God save your grace!
PRINCE HENRY
And yours, most noble Bardolph!
BARDOLPH
Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must yoube blushing?
wherefore blush you now? What amaidenly man-at-arms are you become!
Is't such amatter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?
Page
A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a redlattice, and I could discern no part of his facefrom the window: at last I spied his eyes, andmethought he had made two holes in the ale-wife'snew petticoat and so peeped through.
PRINCE HENRY
Has not the boy profited?
BARDOLPH
Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
Page
Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!
PRINCE HENRY
Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?
Page
Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was deliveredof a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.
PRINCE HENRY
A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,boy.
POINS
O, that this good blossom could be kept fromcankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.
BARDOLPH
An you do not make him hanged among you, thegallows shall have wrong.
PRINCE HENRY
And how doth thy master, Bardolph?
BARDOLPH
Well, my lord.
He heard of your grace's coming totown: there's a letter for you.
POINS
Delivered with good respect.
And how doth themartlemas, your master?
BARDOLPH
In bodily health, sir.
POINS
Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; butthat moves not him: though that be sick, it diesnot.
PRINCE HENRY
I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as mydog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.
POINS
[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man mustknow that, as oft as he has occasion to namehimself: even like those that are kin to the king;for they never prick their finger but they say,'There's some of the king's blood spilt.
' 'Howcomes that?
' says he, that takes upon him not toconceive.
The answer is as ready as a borrower'scap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.
'PRINCE HENRY
Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch itfrom Japhet.
But to the letter.POINS
[Reads]  'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son ofthe king, nearest his father, Harry Prince ofWales, greeting.
' Why, this is a certificate.PRINCE HENRY
Peace!
POINS
[Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans inbrevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,short-winded.
'I commend me to thee, I commendthee, and I leave thee.
Be not too familiar withPoins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that heswears thou art to marry his sister Nell.
Repentat idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.
Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as tosay, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with myfamiliars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,and SIR JOHN with all Europe.
'My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
PRINCE HENRY
That's to make him eat twenty of his words.
But doyou use me thus, Ned?
must I marry your sister?POINS
God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.
PRINCE HENRY
Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and thespirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
Is your master here in London?
BARDOLPH
Yea, my lord.
PRINCE HENRY
Where sups he?
doth the old boar feed in the old frank?BARDOLPH
At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.
PRINCE HENRY
What company?
Page
Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
PRINCE HENRY
Sup any women with him?
Page
None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly andMistress Doll Tearsheet.
PRINCE HENRY
What pagan may that be?
Page
A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.
PRINCE HENRY
Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the townbull.
Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?POINS
I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.
PRINCE HENRY
Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to yourmaster that I am yet come to town: there's foryour silence.
BARDOLPH
I have no tongue, sir.
Page
And for mine, sir, I will govern it.
PRINCE HENRY
Fare you well; go.
This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.
POINS
I warrant you, as common as the way between SaintAlban's and London.
PRINCE HENRY
How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-nightin his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?
POINS
Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and waitupon him at his table as drawers.
PRINCE HENRY
From a God to a bull? a heavy decension!
it wasJove's case.
From a prince to a prentice? a lowtransformation!
that shall be mine; for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly.
Follow me, Ned.
