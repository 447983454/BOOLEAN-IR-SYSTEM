An ante-chamber in the palace.
Chamberlain
'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, withall the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, andfurnished.
They were young and handsome, and of thebest breed in the north.
When they were ready toset out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, bycommission and main power, took 'em from me; withthis reason: His master would be served before asubject, if not before the king; which stopped ourmouths, sir.
'I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:He will have all, I think.
NORFOLK
Well met, my lord chamberlain.
Chamberlain
Good day to both your graces.
SUFFOLK
How is the king employ'd?
Chamberlain
I left him private,Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
NORFOLK
What's the cause?
Chamberlain
It seems the marriage with his brother's wifeHas crept too near his conscience.
SUFFOLK
No, his conscienceHas crept too near another lady.
NORFOLK
'Tis so:This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,Turns what he list.
The king will know him one day.SUFFOLK
Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.
NORFOLK
How holily he works in all his business!
And with what zeal!
for, now he has crack'd the leagueBetween us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,He dives into the king's soul, and there scattersDangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:And out of all these to restore the king,He counsels a divorce; a loss of herThat, like a jewel, has hung twenty yearsAbout his neck, yet never lost her lustre;Of her that loves him with that excellenceThat angels love good men with; even of herThat, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?
Chamberlain
Heaven keep me from such counsel!
'Tis most trueThese news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,And every true heart weeps for't: all that dareLook into these affairs see this main end,The French king's sister.
Heaven will one day openThe king's eyes, that so long have slept uponThis bold bad man.
SUFFOLK
And free us from his slavery.
NORFOLK
We had need pray,And heartily, for our deliverance;Or this imperious man will work us allFrom princes into pages: all men's honoursLie like one lump before him, to be fashion'dInto what pitch he please.
SUFFOLK
For me, my lords,I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:As I am made without him, so I'll stand,If the king please; his curses and his blessingsTouch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.
I knew him, and I know him; so I leave himTo him that made him proud, the pope.
NORFOLK
Let's in;And with some other business put the kingFrom these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:My lord, you'll bear us company?
Chamberlain
Excuse me;The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:Health to your lordships.
NORFOLK
Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.
SUFFOLK
How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.
KING HENRY VIII
Who's there, ha?
NORFOLK
Pray God he be not angry.
KING HENRY VIII
Who's there, I say?
How dare you thrust yourselvesInto my private meditations?
Who am I?
ha?NORFOLK
A gracious king that pardons all offencesMalice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this wayIs business of estate; in which we comeTo know your royal pleasure.
KING HENRY VIII
Ye are too bold:Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?
Who's there?
my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,The quiet of my wounded conscience;Thou art a cure fit for a king.
You're welcome,Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom:Use us and it.
My good lord, have great careI be not found a talker.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Sir, you cannot.
I would your grace would give us but an hourOf private conference.
KING HENRY VIII
[To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]We are busy; go.
NORFOLK
[Aside to SUFFOLK]This priest has no pride in him?
SUFFOLK
[Aside to NORFOLK]             Not to speak of:I would not be so sick though for his place:But this cannot continue.
NORFOLK
[Aside to SUFFOLK]      If it do,I'll venture one have-at-him.
SUFFOLK
[Aside to NORFOLK]          I another.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Your grace has given a precedent of wisdomAbove all princes, in committing freelyYour scruple to the voice of Christendom:Who can be angry now?
what envy reach you?The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,Must now confess, if they have any goodness,The trial just and noble.
All the clerks,I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdomsHave their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,Invited by your noble self, hath sentOne general tongue unto us, this good man,This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;Whom once more I present unto your highness.
KING HENRY VIII
And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,And thank the holy conclave for their loves:They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,You are so noble.
To your highness' handI tender my commission; by whose virtue,The court of Rome commanding, you, my lordCardinal of York, are join'd with me their servantIn the unpartial judging of this business.
KING HENRY VIII
Two equal men.
The queen shall be acquaintedForthwith for what you come.
Where's Gardiner?CARDINAL WOLSEY
I know your majesty has always loved herSo dear in heart, not to deny her thatA woman of less place might ask by law:Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.
KING HENRY VIII
Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favourTo him that does best: God forbid else.
Cardinal,Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:I find him a fit fellow.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
[Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand much joy andfavour to you;You are the king's now.
GARDINER
[Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY]But to be commandedFor ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.
KING HENRY VIII
Come hither, Gardiner.
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
My Lord of York, was not one Doctor PaceIn this man's place before him?
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Yes, he was.
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
Was he not held a learned man?
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Yes, surely.
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread thenEven of yourself, lord cardinal.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
How!
of me?CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
They will not stick to say you envied him,And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,That he ran mad and died.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Heaven's peace be with him!
That's Christian care enough: for living murmurersThere's places of rebuke.
He was a fool;For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,If I command him, follows my appointment:I will have none so near else.
Learn this, brother,We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.
KING HENRY VIII
Deliver this with modesty to the queen.
The most convenient place that I can think ofFor such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
My Wolsey, see it furnish'd.
O, my lord,Would it not grieve an able man to leaveSo sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!
O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.
