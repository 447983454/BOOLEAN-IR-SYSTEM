GARDINER
It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?
Boy
It hath struck.
GARDINER
These should be hours for necessities,Not for delights; times to repair our natureWith comforting repose, and not for usTo waste these times.
Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!Whither so late?
LOVELL
                  Came you from the king, my lordGARDINER
I did, Sir Thomas: and left him at primeroWith the Duke of Suffolk.
LOVELL
I must to him too,Before he go to bed.
I'll take my leave.GARDINER
Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell.
What's the matter?It seems you are in haste: an if there beNo great offence belongs to't, give your friendSome touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,As they say spirits do, at midnight, haveIn them a wilder nature than the businessThat seeks dispatch by day.
LOVELL
My lord, I love you;And durst commend a secret to your earMuch weightier than this work.
The queen's in labour,They say, in great extremity; and fear'dShe'll with the labour end.
GARDINER
The fruit she goes withI pray for heartily, that it may findGood time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,I wish it grubb'd up now.
LOVELL
Methinks I couldCry the amen; and yet my conscience saysShe's a good creature, and, sweet lady, doesDeserve our better wishes.
GARDINER
But, sir, sir,Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentlemanOf mine own way; I know you wise, religious;And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,Sleep in their graves.
LOVELL
Now, sir, you speak of twoThe most remark'd i' the kingdom.
As for Cromwell,Beside that of the jewel house, is made masterO' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,With which the time will load him.
The archbishopIs the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speakOne syllable against him?
GARDINER
Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,There are that dare; and I myself have venturedTo speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,Sir, I may tell it you, I think I haveIncensed the lords o' the council, that he is,For so I know he is, they know he is,A most arch heretic, a pestilenceThat does infect the land: with which they movedHave broken with the king; who hath so farGiven ear to our complaint, of his great graceAnd princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefsOur reasons laid before him, hath commandedTo-morrow morning to the council-boardHe be convented.
He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,And we must root him out.
From your affairsI hinder you too long: good night, Sir Thomas.
LOVELL
Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.
KING HENRY VIII
Charles, I will play no more tonight;My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.
SUFFOLK
Sir, I did never win of you before.
KING HENRY VIII
But little, Charles;Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.
Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?
LOVELL
I could not personally deliver to herWhat you commanded me, but by her womanI sent your message; who return'd her thanksIn the great'st humbleness, and desired your highnessMost heartily to pray for her.
KING HENRY VIII
What say'st thou, ha?
To pray for her?
what, is she crying out?LOVELL
So said her woman; and that her sufferance madeAlmost each pang a death.
KING HENRY VIII
Alas, good lady!
SUFFOLK
God safely quit her of her burthen, andWith gentle travail, to the gladding ofYour highness with an heir!
KING HENRY VIII
'Tis midnight, Charles;Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers rememberThe estate of my poor queen.
Leave me alone;For I must think of that which companyWould not be friendly to.
SUFFOLK
I wish your highnessA quiet night; and my good mistress willRemember in my prayers.
KING HENRY VIII
Charles, good night.
Well, sir, what follows?
DENNY
Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,As you commanded me.
KING HENRY VIII
Ha!
Canterbury?DENNY
Ay, my good lord.
KING HENRY VIII
'Tis true: where is he, Denny?
DENNY
He attends your highness' pleasure.
LOVELL
[Aside]  This is about that which the bishop spake:I am happily come hither.
KING HENRY VIII
Avoid the gallery.
Ha! I have said.
Be gone. What!CRANMER
[Aside]I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?
'Tis his aspect of terror.
All's not well.KING HENRY VIII
How now, my lord!
you desire to knowWherefore I sent for you.
CRANMER
[Kneeling]              It is my dutyTo attend your highness' pleasure.
KING HENRY VIII
Pray you, arise,My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
Come, you and I must walk a turn together;I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand.
Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,And am right sorry to repeat what followsI have, and most unwillingly, of lateHeard many grievous, I do say, my lord,Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,Have moved us and our council, that you shallThis morning come before us; where, I know,You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,But that, till further trial in those chargesWhich will require your answer, you must takeYour patience to you, and be well contentedTo make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,It fits we thus proceed, or else no witnessWould come against you.
CRANMER
[Kneeling]I humbly thank your highness;And am right glad to catch this good occasionMost throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaffAnd corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,There's none stands under more calumnious tonguesThan I myself, poor man.
KING HENRY VIII
Stand up, good Canterbury:Thy truth and thy integrity is rootedIn us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:Prithee, let's walk.
Now, by my holidame.What manner of man are you?
My lord, I look'dYou would have given me your petition, thatI should have ta'en some pains to bring togetherYourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,Without indurance, further.
CRANMER
Most dread liege,The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,Being of those virtues vacant.
I fear nothingWhat can be said against me.
KING HENRY VIII
Know you notHow your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?
Your enemies are many, and not small; their practisesMust bear the same proportion; and not everThe justice and the truth o' the question carriesThe due o' the verdict with it: at what easeMight corrupt minds procure knaves as corruptTo swear against you? such things have been done.
You are potently opposed; and with a maliceOf as great size.
Ween you of better luck,I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,Whose minister you are, whiles here he livedUpon this naughty earth?
Go to, go to;You take a precipice for no leap of danger,And woo your own destruction.
CRANMER
God and your majestyProtect mine innocence, or I fall intoThe trap is laid for me!
KING HENRY VIII
Be of good cheer;They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
Keep comfort to you; and this morning seeYou do appear before them: if they shall chance,In charging you with matters, to commit you,The best persuasions to the contraryFail not to use, and with what vehemencyThe occasion shall instruct you: if entreatiesWill render you no remedy, this ringDeliver them, and your appeal to usThere make before them.
Look, the good man weeps!He's honest, on mine honour.
God's blest mother!I swear he is true--hearted; and a soulNone better in my kingdom.
Get you gone,And do as I have bid you.
He has strangledHis language in his tears.
Gentleman
[Within]                 Come back: what mean you?
Old Lady
I'll not come back; the tidings that I bringWill make my boldness manners.
Now, good angelsFly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy personUnder their blessed wings!
KING HENRY VIII
Now, by thy looksI guess thy message.
Is the queen deliver'd?Say, ay; and of a boy.
Old Lady
Ay, ay, my liege;And of a lovely boy: the God of heavenBoth now and ever bless her!
'tis a girl,Promises boys hereafter.
Sir, your queenDesires your visitation, and to beAcquainted with this stranger 'tis as like youAs cherry is to cherry.
KING HENRY VIII
Lovell!
LOVELL
Sir?
KING HENRY VIII
Give her an hundred marks.
I'll to the queen.Old Lady
An hundred marks! By this light, I'll ha' more.
An ordinary groom is for such payment.
I will have more, or scold it out of him.
Said I for this, the girl was like to him?
I will have more, or else unsay't; and now,While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.
