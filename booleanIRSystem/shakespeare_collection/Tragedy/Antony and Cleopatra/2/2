Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.
LEPIDUS
Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,And shall become you well, to entreat your captainTo soft and gentle speech.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I shall entreat himTo answer like himself: if Caesar move him,Let Antony look over Caesar's headAnd speak as loud as Mars.
By Jupiter,Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,I would not shave't to-day.
LEPIDUS
'Tis not a timeFor private stomaching.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Every timeServes for the matter that is then born in't.
LEPIDUS
But small to greater matters must give way.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Not if the small come first.
LEPIDUS
Your speech is passion:But, pray you, stir no embers up.
Here comesThe noble Antony.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
And yonder, Caesar.
MARK ANTONY
If we compose well here, to Parthia:Hark, Ventidius.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
                  I do not know,Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.
LEPIDUS
Noble friends,That which combined us was most great, and let notA leaner action rend us.
What's amiss,May it be gently heard: when we debateOur trivial difference loud, we do commitMurder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,The rather, for I earnestly beseech,Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,Nor curstness grow to the matter.
MARK ANTONY
'Tis spoken well.
Were we before our armies, and to fight.
I should do thus.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Welcome to Rome.
MARK ANTONY
Thank you.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Sit.
MARK ANTONY
Sit, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Nay, then.
MARK ANTONY
I learn, you take things ill which are not so,Or being, concern you not.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I must be laugh'd at,If, or for nothing or a little, IShould say myself offended, and with youChiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I shouldOnce name you derogately, when to sound your nameIt not concern'd me.
MARK ANTONY
My being in Egypt, Caesar,What was't to you?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
No more than my residing here at RomeMight be to you in Egypt: yet, if you thereDid practise on my state, your being in EgyptMight be my question.
MARK ANTONY
How intend you, practised?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
You may be pleased to catch at mine intentBy what did here befal me.
Your wife and brotherMade wars upon me; and their contestationWas theme for you, you were the word of war.
MARK ANTONY
You do mistake your business; my brother neverDid urge me in his act: I did inquire it;And have my learning from some true reports,That drew their swords with you.
Did he not ratherDiscredit my authority with yours;And make the wars alike against my stomach,Having alike your cause?
Of this my lettersBefore did satisfy you.
If you'll patch a quarrel,As matter whole you have not to make it with,It must not be with this.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
You praise yourselfBy laying defects of judgment to me; butYou patch'd up your excuses.
MARK ANTONY
Not so, not so;I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,Very necessity of this thought, that I,Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,Could not with graceful eyes attend those warsWhich fronted mine own peace.
As for my wife,I would you had her spirit in such another:The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffleYou may pace easy, but not such a wife.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Would we had all such wives, that the men might goto wars with the women!
MARK ANTONY
So much uncurbable, her garboils, CaesarMade out of her impatience, which not wantedShrewdness of policy too, I grieving grantDid you too much disquiet: for that you mustBut say, I could not help it.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I wrote to youWhen rioting in Alexandria; youDid pocket up my letters, and with tauntsDid gibe my missive out of audience.
MARK ANTONY
Sir,He fell upon me ere admitted: thenThree kings I had newly feasted, and did wantOf what I was i' the morning: but next dayI told him of myself; which was as muchAs to have ask'd him pardon.
Let this fellowBe nothing of our strife; if we contend,Out of our question wipe him.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
You have brokenThe article of your oath; which you shall neverHave tongue to charge me with.
LEPIDUS
Soft, Caesar!
MARK ANTONY
No,Lepidus, let him speak:The honour is sacred which he talks on now,Supposing that I lack'd it.
But, on, Caesar;The article of my oath.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
To lend me arms and aid when I required them;The which you both denied.
MARK ANTONY
Neglected, rather;And then when poison'd hours had bound me upFrom mine own knowledge.
As nearly as I may,I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honestyShall not make poor my greatness, nor my powerWork without it.
Truth is, that Fulvia,To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;For which myself, the ignorant motive, doSo far ask pardon as befits mine honourTo stoop in such a case.
LEPIDUS
'Tis noble spoken.
MECAENAS
If it might please you, to enforce no furtherThe griefs between ye: to forget them quiteWere to remember that the present needSpeaks to atone you.
LEPIDUS
Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Or, if you borrow one another's love for theinstant, you may, when you hear no more words ofPompey, return it again: you shall have time towrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
MARK ANTONY
Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
MARK ANTONY
You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Go to, then; your considerate stone.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I do not much dislike the matter, butThe manner of his speech; for't cannot beWe shall remain in friendship, our conditionsSo differing in their acts.
Yet if I knewWhat hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edgeO' the world I would pursue it.
AGRIPPA
Give me leave, Caesar,--OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Speak, Agrippa.
AGRIPPA
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,Admired Octavia: great Mark AntonyIs now a widower.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
                  Say not so, Agrippa:If Cleopatra heard you, your reproofWere well deserved of rashness.
MARK ANTONY
I am not married, Caesar: let me hearAgrippa further speak.
AGRIPPA
To hold you in perpetual amity,To make you brothers, and to knit your heartsWith an unslipping  knot, take AntonyOctavia to his wife; whose beauty claimsNo worse a husband than the best of men;Whose virtue and whose general graces speakThat which none else can utter.
By this marriage,All little jealousies, which now seem great,And all great fears, which now import their dangers,Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,Where now half tales be truths: her love to bothWould, each to other and all loves to both,Draw after her.
Pardon what I have spoke;For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,By duty ruminated.
MARK ANTONY
Will Caesar speak?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'dWith what is spoke already.
MARK ANTONY
What power is in Agrippa,If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'To make this good?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
                  The power of Caesar, andHis power unto Octavia.
MARK ANTONY
May I neverTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,Dream of impediment!
Let me have thy hand:Further this act of grace: and from this hourThe heart of brothers govern in our lovesAnd sway our great designs!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
There is my hand.
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brotherDid ever love so dearly: let her liveTo join our kingdoms and our hearts; and neverFly off our loves again!
LEPIDUS
Happily, amen!
MARK ANTONY
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;For he hath laid strange courtesies and greatOf late upon me: I must thank him only,Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;At heel of that, defy him.
LEPIDUS
Time calls upon's:Of us must Pompey presently be sought,Or else he seeks out us.
MARK ANTONY
Where lies he?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
About the mount Misenum.
MARK ANTONY
What is his strength by land?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Great and increasing: but by seaHe is an absolute master.
MARK ANTONY
So is the fame.
Would we had spoke together!
Haste we for it:Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch weThe business we have talk'd of.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
With most gladness:And do invite you to my sister's view,Whither straight I'll lead you.
MARK ANTONY
Let us, Lepidus,Not lack your company.
LEPIDUS
Noble Antony,Not sickness should detain me.
MECAENAS
Welcome from Egypt, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas!
Myhonourable friend, Agrippa!
AGRIPPA
Good Enobarbus!
MECAENAS
We have cause to be glad that matters are so welldigested.
You stayed well by 't in Egypt.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, andmade the night light with drinking.
MECAENAS
Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, andbut twelve persons there; is this true?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much moremonstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
MECAENAS
She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square toher.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed uphis heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
AGRIPPA
There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devisedwell for her.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I will tell you.
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;Purple the sails, and so perfumed thatThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and madeThe water which they beat to follow faster,As amorous of their strokes.
For her own person,It beggar'd all description: she did lieIn her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--O'er-picturing that Venus where we seeThe fancy outwork nature: on each side herStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seemTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,And what they undid did.
AGRIPPA
O, rare for Antony!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,And made their bends adornings: at the helmA seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackleSwell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,That yarely frame the office.
From the bargeA strange invisible perfume hits the senseOf the adjacent wharfs.
The city castHer people out upon her; and Antony,Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,And made a gap in nature.
AGRIPPA
Rare Egyptian!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,Invited her to supper: she replied,It should be better he became her guest;Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,And for his ordinary pays his heartFor what his eyes eat only.
AGRIPPA
Royal wench!
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I saw her onceHop forty paces through the public street;And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,That she did make defect perfection,And, breathless, power breathe forth.
MECAENAS
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Never; he will not:Age cannot wither her, nor custom staleHer infinite variety: other women cloyThe appetites they feed: but she makes hungryWhere most she satisfies; for vilest thingsBecome themselves in her: that the holy priestsBless her when she is riggish.
MECAENAS
If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settleThe heart of Antony, Octavia isA blessed lottery to him.
AGRIPPA
Let us go.
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guestWhilst you abide here.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Humbly, sir, I thank you.
