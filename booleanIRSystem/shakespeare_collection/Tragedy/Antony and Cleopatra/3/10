Another part of the plain.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Naught, naught all, naught!
I can behold no longer:The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:To see't mine eyes are blasted.
SCARUS
Gods and goddesses,All the whole synod of them!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
What's thy passion!
SCARUS
The greater cantle of the world is lostWith very ignorance; we have kiss'd awayKingdoms and provinces.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
How appears the fight?
SCARUS
On our side like the token'd pestilence,Where death is sure.
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--Whom leprosy o'ertake!
--i' the midst o' the fight,When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,The breese upon her, like a cow in June,Hoists sails and flies.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
That I beheld:Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could notEndure a further view.
SCARUS
She once being loof'd,The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:I never saw an action of such shame;Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er beforeDid violate so itself.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Alack, alack!
CANIDIUS
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,And sinks most lamentably.
Had our generalBeen what he knew himself, it had gone well:O, he has given example for our flight,Most grossly, by his own!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Why, then, good night indeed.
CANIDIUS
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
SCARUS
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attendWhat further comes.
CANIDIUS
To Caesar will I renderMy legions and my horse: six kings alreadyShow me the way of yielding.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I'll yet followThe wounded chance of Antony, though my reasonSits in the wind against me.
