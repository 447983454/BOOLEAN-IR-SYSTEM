DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
How now, friend Eros!
EROS
There's strange news come, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
What, man?
EROS
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
This is old: what is the success?
EROS
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainstPompey, presently denied him rivality; would not lethim partake in the glory of the action: and notresting here, accuses him of letters he had formerlywrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: sothe poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;And throw between them all the food thou hast,They'll grind the one the other.
Where's Antony?EROS
He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurnsThe rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!
'And threats the throat of that his officerThat murder'd Pompey.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Our great navy's rigg'd.
EROS
For Italy and Caesar.
More, Domitius;My lord desires you presently: my newsI might have told hereafter.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
'Twill be naught:But let it be.
Bring me to Antony.EROS
Come, sir.
