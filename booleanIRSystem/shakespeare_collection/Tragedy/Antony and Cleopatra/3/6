Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,Cleopatra and himself in chairs of goldWere publicly enthroned: at the feet satCaesarion, whom they call my father's son,And all the unlawful issue that their lustSince then hath made between them.
Unto herHe gave the stablishment of Egypt; made herOf lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,Absolute queen.
MECAENAS
This in the public eye?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'dSyria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: sheIn the habiliments of the goddess IsisThat day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,As 'tis reported, so.
MECAENAS
Let Rome be thus Inform'd.
AGRIPPA
Who, queasy with his insolenceAlready, will their good thoughts call from him.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
The people know it; and have now receivedHis accusations.
AGRIPPA
Who does he accuse?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Caesar: and that, having in SicilySextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated himHis part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent meSome shipping unrestored: lastly, he fretsThat Lepidus of the triumvirateShould be deposed; and, being, that we detainAll his revenue.
AGRIPPA
Sir, this should be answer'd.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;That he his high authority abused,And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, IDemand the like.
MECAENAS
He'll never yield to that.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
OCTAVIA
Hail, Caesar, and my lord!
hail, most dear Caesar!OCTAVIUS CAESAR
That ever I should call thee castaway!
OCTAVIA
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Why have you stol'n upon us thus!
You come notLike Caesar's sister: the wife of AntonyShould have an army for an usher, andThe neighs of horse to tell of her approachLong ere she did appear; the trees by the wayShould have borne men; and expectation fainted,Longing for what it had not; nay, the dustShould have ascended to the roof of heaven,Raised by your populous troops: but you are comeA market-maid to Rome; and have preventedThe ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,Is often left unloved; we should have met youBy sea and land; supplying every stageWith an augmented greeting.
OCTAVIA
Good my lord,To come thus was I not constrain'd, but didOn my free will.
My lord, Mark Antony,Hearing that you prepared for war, acquaintedMy grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'dHis pardon for return.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Which soon he granted,Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
OCTAVIA
Do not say so, my lord.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I have eyes upon him,And his affairs come to me on the wind.
Where is he now?
OCTAVIA
My lord, in Athens.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
No, my most wronged sister; CleopatraHath nodded him to her.
He hath given his empireUp to a whore; who now are levyingThe kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembledBocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, kingOf Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, kingOf Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,With a more larger list of sceptres.
OCTAVIA
Ay me, most wretched,That have my heart parted betwixt two friendsThat do afflict each other!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Welcome hither:Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,And we in negligent danger.
Cheer your heart;Be you not troubled with the time, which drivesO'er your content these strong necessities;But let determined things to destinyHold unbewail'd their way.
Welcome to Rome;Nothing more dear to me.
You are abusedBeyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,To do you justice, make them ministersOf us and those that love you.
Best of comfort;And ever welcome to us.
AGRIPPA
Welcome, lady.
MECAENAS
Welcome, dear madam.
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:Only the adulterous Antony, most largeIn his abominations, turns you off;And gives his potent regiment to a trull,That noises it against us.
OCTAVIA
Is it so, sir?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Most certain.
Sister, welcome: pray you,Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!
