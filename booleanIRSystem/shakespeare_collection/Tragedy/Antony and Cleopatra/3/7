Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.
CLEOPATRA
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But why, why, why?
CLEOPATRA
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,And say'st it is not fit.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Well, is it, is it?
CLEOPATRA
If not denounced against us, why should not weBe there in person?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
[Aside]  Well, I could reply:If we should serve with horse and mares together,The horse were merely lost; the mares would bearA soldier and his horse.
CLEOPATRA
What is't you say?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;Take from his heart, take from his brain,from's time,What should not then be spared.
He is alreadyTraduced for levity; and 'tis said in RomeThat Photinus an eunuch and your maidsManage this war.
CLEOPATRA
                  Sink Rome, and their tongues rotThat speak against us!
A charge we bear i' the war,And, as the president of my kingdom, willAppear there for a man.
Speak not against it:I will not stay behind.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Nay, I have done.
Here comes the emperor.
MARK ANTONY
Is it not strange, Canidius,That from Tarentum and BrundusiumHe could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,And take in Toryne?
You have heard on't, sweet?CLEOPATRA
Celerity is never more admiredThan by the negligent.
MARK ANTONY
A good rebuke,Which might have well becomed the best of men,To taunt at slackness.
Canidius, weWill fight with him by sea.
CLEOPATRA
By sea!
what else?CANIDIUS
Why will my lord do so?
MARK ANTONY
For that he dares us to't.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
CANIDIUS
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;And so should you.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
                  Your ships are not well mann'd;Your mariners are muleters, reapers, peopleIngross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleetAre those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgraceShall fall you for refusing him at sea,Being prepared for land.
MARK ANTONY
By sea, by sea.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Most worthy sir, you therein throw awayThe absolute soldiership you have by land;Distract your army, which doth most consistOf war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecutedYour own renowned knowledge; quite foregoThe way which promises assurance; andGive up yourself merely to chance and hazard,From firm security.
MARK ANTONY
I'll fight at sea.
CLEOPATRA
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
MARK ANTONY
Our overplus of shipping will we burn;And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of ActiumBeat the approaching Caesar.
But if we fail,We then can do't at land.
Thy business?
Messenger
The news is true, my lord; he is descried;Caesar has taken Toryne.
MARK ANTONY
Can he be there in person?
'tis impossible;Strange that power should be.
Canidius,Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,And our twelve thousand horse.
We'll to our ship:Away, my Thetis!
How now, worthy soldier?
Soldier
O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubtThis sword and these my wounds?
Let the EgyptiansAnd the Phoenicians go a-ducking; weHave used to conquer, standing on the earth,And fighting foot to foot.
MARK ANTONY
Well, well: away!
Soldier
By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.
CANIDIUS
Soldier, thou art: but his whole action growsNot in the power on't: so our leader's led,And we are women's men.
Soldier
You keep by landThe legions and the horse whole, do you not?
CANIDIUS
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:But we keep whole by land.
This speed of Caesar'sCarries beyond belief.
Soldier
While he was yet in Rome,His power went out in such distractions asBeguiled all spies.
CANIDIUS
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
Soldier
They say, one Taurus.
CANIDIUS
Well I know the man.
Messenger
The emperor calls Canidius.
CANIDIUS
With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,Each minute, some.
