Alexandria. A room in the monument.
CLEOPATRA
My desolation does begin to makeA better life.
'Tis paltry to be Caesar;Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,A minister of her will: and it is greatTo do that thing that ends all other deeds;Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
PROCULEIUS
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;And bids thee study on what fair demandsThou mean'st to have him grant thee.
CLEOPATRA
What's thy name?
PROCULEIUS
My name is Proculeius.
CLEOPATRA
AntonyDid tell me of you, bade me trust you; butI do not greatly care to be deceived,That have no use for trusting.
If your masterWould have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,That majesty, to keep decorum, mustNo less beg than a kingdom: if he pleaseTo give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,He gives me so much of mine own, as IWill kneel to him with thanks.
PROCULEIUS
Be of good cheer;You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:Make your full reference freely to my lord,Who is so full of grace, that it flows overOn all that need: let me report to himYour sweet dependency; and you shall findA conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
CLEOPATRA
Pray you, tell himI am his fortune's vassal, and I send himThe greatness he has got.
I hourly learnA doctrine of obedience; and would gladlyLook him i' the face.
PROCULEIUS
This I'll report, dear lady.
Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitiedOf him that caused it.
GALLUS
You see how easily she may be surprised:Guard her till Caesar come.
IRAS
Royal queen!
CHARMIAN
O Cleopatra!
thou art taken, queen:CLEOPATRA
Quick, quick, good hands.
PROCULEIUS
Hold, worthy lady, hold:Do not yourself such wrong, who are in thisRelieved, but not betray'd.
CLEOPATRA
What, of death too,That rids our dogs of languish?
PROCULEIUS
Cleopatra,Do not abuse my master's bounty byThe undoing of yourself: let the world seeHis nobleness well acted, which your deathWill never let come forth.
CLEOPATRA
Where art thou, death?
Come hither, come!
come, come, and take a queenWorthy many babes and beggars!
PROCULEIUS
O, temperance, lady!
CLEOPATRA
Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;If idle talk will once be necessary,I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,Do Caesar what he can.
Know, sir, that IWill not wait pinion'd at your master's court;Nor once be chastised with the sober eyeOf dull Octavia.
Shall they hoist me upAnd show me to the shouting varletryOf censuring Rome?
Rather a ditch in EgyptBe gentle grave unto me!
rather on Nilus' mudLay me stark naked, and let the water-fliesBlow me into abhorring!
rather makeMy country's high pyramides my gibbet,And hang me up in chains!
PROCULEIUS
You do extendThese thoughts of horror further than you shallFind cause in Caesar.
DOLABELLA
Proculeius,What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,I'll take her to my guard.
PROCULEIUS
So, Dolabella,It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,If you'll employ me to him.
CLEOPATRA
Say, I would die.
DOLABELLA
Most noble empress, you have heard of me?
CLEOPATRA
I cannot tell.
DOLABELLA
Assuredly you know me.
CLEOPATRA
No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;Is't not your trick?
DOLABELLA
I understand not, madam.
CLEOPATRA
I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:O, such another sleep, that I might seeBut such another man!
DOLABELLA
If it might please ye,--CLEOPATRA
His face was as the heavens; and therein stuckA sun and moon, which kept their course,and lightedThe little O, the earth.
DOLABELLA
Most sovereign creature,--CLEOPATRA
His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd armCrested the world: his voice was propertiedAs all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,He was as rattling thunder.
For his bounty,There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twasThat grew the more by reaping: his delightsWere dolphin-like; they show'd his back aboveThe element they lived in: in his liveryWalk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands wereAs plates dropp'd from his pocket.
DOLABELLA
Cleopatra!
CLEOPATRA
Think you there was, or might be, such a manAs this I dream'd of?
DOLABELLA
Gentle madam, no.
CLEOPATRA
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
But, if there be, or ever were, one such,It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuffTo vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagineAnd Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,Condemning shadows quite.
DOLABELLA
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear itAs answering to the weight: would I might neverO'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,By the rebound of yours, a grief that smitesMy very heart at root.
CLEOPATRA
I thank you, sir,Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
DOLABELLA
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
CLEOPATRA
Nay, pray you, sir,--DOLABELLA
Though he be honourable,--CLEOPATRA
He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
DOLABELLA
Madam, he will; I know't.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Which is the Queen of Egypt?
DOLABELLA
It is the emperor, madam.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Arise, you shall not kneel:I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
CLEOPATRA
Sir, the godsWill have it thus; my master and my lordI must obey.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
                  Take to you no hard thoughts:The record of what injuries you did us,Though written in our flesh, we shall rememberAs things but done by chance.
CLEOPATRA
Sole sir o' the world,I cannot project mine own cause so wellTo make it clear; but do confess I haveBeen laden with like frailties which beforeHave often shamed our sex.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Cleopatra, know,We will extenuate rather than enforce:If you apply yourself to our intents,Which towards you are most gentle, you shall findA benefit in this change; but if you seekTo lay on me a cruelty, by takingAntony's course, you shall bereave yourselfOf my good purposes, and put your childrenTo that destruction which I'll guard them from,If thereon you rely.
I'll take my leave.CLEOPATRA
And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shallHang in what place you please.
Here, my good lord.OCTAVIUS CAESAR
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
CLEOPATRA
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;Not petty things admitted.
Where's Seleucus?SELEUCUS
Here, madam.
CLEOPATRA
This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,Upon his peril, that I have reservedTo myself nothing.
Speak the truth, Seleucus.SELEUCUS
Madam,I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,Speak that which is not.
CLEOPATRA
What have I kept back?
SELEUCUS
Enough to purchase what you have made known.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approveYour wisdom in the deed.
CLEOPATRA
See, Caesar!
O, behold,How pomp is follow'd!
mine will now be yours;And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
The ingratitude of this Seleucus doesEven make me wild: O slave, of no more trustThan love that's hired!
What, goest thou back? thou shaltGo back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
O rarely base!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Good queen, let us entreat you.
CLEOPATRA
O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,Doing the honour of thy lordlinessTo one so meek, that mine own servant shouldParcel the sum of my disgraces byAddition of his envy!
Say, good Caesar,That I some lady trifles have reserved,Immoment toys, things of such dignityAs we greet modern friends withal; and say,Some nobler token I have kept apartFor Livia and Octavia, to induceTheir mediation; must I be unfoldedWith one that I have bred? The gods!
it smites meBeneath the fall I have.
Prithee, go hence;Or I shall show the cinders of my spiritsThrough the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Forbear, Seleucus.
CLEOPATRA
Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthoughtFor things that others do; and, when we fall,We answer others' merits in our name,Are therefore to be pitied.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Cleopatra,Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with youOf things that merchants sold.
Therefore be cheer'd;Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;For we intend so to dispose you asYourself shall give us counsel.
Feed, and sleep:Our care and pity is so much upon you,That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
CLEOPATRA
My master, and my lord!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Not so.
Adieu.CLEOPATRA
He words me, girls, he words me, that I should notBe noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.
IRAS
Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,And we are for the dark.
CLEOPATRA
Hie thee again:I have spoke already, and it is provided;Go put it to the haste.
CHARMIAN
Madam, I will.
DOLABELLA
Where is the queen?
CHARMIAN
Behold, sir.
CLEOPATRA
Dolabella!
DOLABELLA
Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,Which my love makes religion to obey,I tell you this: Caesar through SyriaIntends his journey; and within three daysYou with your children will he send before:Make your best use of this: I have perform'dYour pleasure and my promise.
CLEOPATRA
Dolabella,I shall remain your debtor.
DOLABELLA
I your servant,Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.
CLEOPATRA
Farewell, and thanks.
Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shownIn Rome, as well as I	mechanic slavesWith greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shallUplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,And forced to drink their vapour.
IRAS
The gods forbid!
CLEOPATRA
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictorsWill catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymersBallad us out o' tune: the quick comediansExtemporally will stage us, and presentOur Alexandrian revels; AntonyShall be brought drunken forth, and I shall seeSome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatnessI' the posture of a whore.
IRAS
O the good gods!
CLEOPATRA
Nay, that's certain.
IRAS
I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nailsAre stronger than mine eyes.
CLEOPATRA
Why, that's the wayTo fool their preparation, and to conquerTheir most absurd intents.
Now, Charmian!
Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetchMy best attires: I am again for Cydnus,To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leaveTo play till doomsday.
Bring our crown and all.Wherefore's this noise?
Guard
Here is a rural fellowThat will not be denied your highness presence:He brings you figs.
CLEOPATRA
Let him come in.
What poor an instrumentMay do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
My resolution's placed, and I have nothingOf woman in me: now from head to footI am marble-constant; now the fleeting moonNo planet is of mine.
Guard
This is the man.
CLEOPATRA
Avoid, and leave him.
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,That kills and pains not?
Clown
Truly, I have him: but I would not be the partythat should desire you to touch him, for his bitingis immortal; those that do die of it do seldom ornever recover.
CLEOPATRA
Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
Clown
Very many, men and women too.
I heard of one ofthem no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,but something given to lie; as a woman should notdo, but in the way of honesty: how she died of thebiting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makesa very good report o' the worm; but he that willbelieve all that they say, shall never be saved byhalf that they do: but this is most fallible, theworm's an odd worm.
CLEOPATRA
Get thee hence; farewell.
Clown
I wish you all joy of the worm.
CLEOPATRA
Farewell.
Clown
You must think this, look you, that the worm willdo his kind.
CLEOPATRA
Ay, ay; farewell.
Clown
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in thekeeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is nogoodness in worm.
CLEOPATRA
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
Clown
Very good.
Give it nothing, I pray you, for it isnot worth the feeding.
CLEOPATRA
Will it eat me?
Clown
You must not think I am so simple but I know thedevil himself will not eat a woman: I know that awoman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress hernot.
But, truly, these same whoreson devils do thegods great harm in their women; for in every tenthat they make, the devils mar five.
CLEOPATRA
Well, get thee gone; farewell.
Clown
Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.
CLEOPATRA
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I haveImmortal longings in me: now no moreThe juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:Yare, yare, good Iras; quick.
Methinks I hearAntony call; I see him rouse himselfTo praise my noble act; I hear him mockThe luck of Caesar, which the gods give menTo excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:Now to that name my courage prove my title!
I am fire and air; my other elementsI give to baser life.
So; have you done?Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
Have I the aspic in my lips?
Dost fall?If thou and nature can so gently part,The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,Which hurts, and is desired.
Dost thou lie still?If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the worldIt is not worth leave-taking.
CHARMIAN
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,The gods themselves do weep!
CLEOPATRA
This proves me base:If she first meet the curled Antony,He'll make demand of her, and spend that kissWhich is my heaven to have.
Come, thoumortal wretch,With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicateOf life at once untie: poor venomous foolBe angry, and dispatch.
O, couldst thou speak,That I might hear thee call great Caesar assUnpolicied!
CHARMIAN
O eastern star!
CLEOPATRA
Peace, peace!
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,That sucks the nurse asleep?
CHARMIAN
O, break!
O, break!CLEOPATRA
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.
What should I stay--CHARMIAN
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession liesA lass unparallel'd.
Downy windows, close;And golden Phoebus never be beheldOf eyes again so royal!
Your crown's awry;I'll mend it, and then play.
First Guard
Where is the queen?
CHARMIAN
Speak softly, wake her not.
First Guard
Caesar hath sent--CHARMIAN
Too slow a messenger.
O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.
First Guard
Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
Second Guard
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
First Guard
What work is here!
Charmian, is this well done?CHARMIAN
It is well done, and fitting for a princessDescended of so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!
DOLABELLA
How goes it here?
Second Guard
All dead.
DOLABELLA
Caesar, thy thoughtsTouch their effects in this: thyself art comingTo see perform'd the dreaded act which thouSo sought'st to hinder.
DOLABELLA
O sir, you are too sure an augurer;That you did fear is done.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Bravest at the last,She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,Took her own way.
The manner of their deaths?I do not see them bleed.
DOLABELLA
Who was last with them?
First Guard
A simple countryman, that brought her figs:This was his basket.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Poison'd, then.
First Guard
O Caesar,This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:I found her trimming up the diademOn her dead mistress; tremblingly she stoodAnd on the sudden dropp'd.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
O noble weakness!
If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appearBy external swelling: but she looks like sleep,As she would catch another AntonyIn her strong toil of grace.
DOLABELLA
Here, on her breast,There is a vent of blood and something blown:The like is on her arm.
First Guard
This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leavesHave slime upon them, such as the aspic leavesUpon the caves of Nile.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Most probableThat so she died; for her physician tells meShe hath pursued conclusions infiniteOf easy ways to die.
Take up her bed;And bear her women from the monument:She shall be buried by her Antony:No grave upon the earth shall clip in itA pair so famous.
High events as theseStrike those that make them; and their story isNo less in pity than his glory whichBrought them to be lamented.
Our army shallIn solemn show attend this funeral;And then to Rome.
Come, Dolabella, seeHigh order in this great solemnity.
