Before Corioli.
MARCIUS
Yonder comes news.
A wager they have met.LARTIUS
My horse to yours, no.
MARCIUS
'Tis done.
LARTIUS
Agreed.
MARCIUS
Say, has our general met the enemy?
Messenger
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
LARTIUS
So, the good horse is mine.
MARCIUS
I'll buy him of you.
LARTIUS
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I willFor half a hundred years.
Summon the town.MARCIUS
How far off lie these armies?
Messenger
Within this mile and half.
MARCIUS
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,That we with smoking swords may march from hence,To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
First Senator
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,That's lesser than a little.
Hark!
our drumsAre bringing forth our youth.
We'll break our walls,Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;They'll open of themselves.
Hark you.
far off!There is Aufidius; list, what work he makesAmongst your cloven army.
MARCIUS
O, they are at it!
LARTIUS
Their noise be our instruction.
Ladders, ho!MARCIUS
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fightWith hearts more proof than shields.
Advance,brave Titus:They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,Which makes me sweat with wrath.
Come on, my fellows:He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,And he shall feel mine edge.
MARCIUS
All the contagion of the south light on you,You shames of Rome!
you herd of--Boils and plaguesPlaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'dFurther than seen and one infect anotherAgainst the wind a mile!
You souls of geese,That bear the shapes of men, how have you runFrom slaves that apes would beat!
Pluto and hell!All hurt behind; backs red, and faces paleWith flight and agued fear!
Mend and charge home,Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foeAnd make my wars on you: look to't: come on;If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,As they us to our trenches followed.
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
First Soldier
Fool-hardiness; not I.
Second Soldier
Nor I.
First Soldier
See, they have shut him in.
All
To the pot, I warrant him.
LARTIUS
What is become of Marcius?
All
Slain, sir, doubtless.
First Soldier
Following the fliers at the very heels,With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,To answer all the city.
LARTIUS
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,And, when it bows, stands up.
Thou art left, Marcius:A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,Were not so rich a jewel.
Thou wast a soldierEven to Cato's wish, not fierce and terribleOnly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks andThe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the worldWere feverous and did tremble.
First Soldier
Look, sir.
LARTIUS
O,'tis Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
