Corioli. A street.
First Roman
This will I carry to Rome.
Second Roman
And I this.
Third Roman
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
MARCIUS
See here these movers that do prize their hoursAt a crack'd drachm!
Cushions, leaden spoons,Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen wouldBury with those that wore them, these base slaves,Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes!
To him!There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, takeConvenient numbers to make good the city;Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will hasteTo help Cominius.
LARTIUS
                  Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;Thy exercise hath been too violent forA second course of fight.
MARCIUS
Sir, praise me not;My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:The blood I drop is rather physicalThan dangerous to me: to Aufidius thusI will appear, and fight.
LARTIUS
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charmsMisguide thy opposers' swords!
Bold gentleman,Prosperity be thy page!
MARCIUS
Thy friend no lessThan those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
LARTIUS
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;Call thither all the officers o' the town,Where they shall know our mind: away!
