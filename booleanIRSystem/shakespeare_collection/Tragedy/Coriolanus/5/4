Rome. A public place.
MENENIUS
See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yondcorner-stone?
SICINIUS
Why, what of that?
MENENIUS
If it be possible for you to displace it with yourlittle finger, there is some hope the ladies ofRome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats aresentenced and stay upon execution.
SICINIUS
Is't possible that so short a time can alter thecondition of a man!
MENENIUS
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;yet your butterfly was a grub.
This Marcius is grownfrom man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than acreeping thing.
SICINIUS
He loved his mother dearly.
MENENIUS
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mothernow than an eight-year-old horse.
The tartnessof his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, hemoves like an engine, and the ground shrinks beforehis treading: he is able to pierce a corslet withhis eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is abattery.
He sits in his state, as a thing made forAlexander.
What he bids be done is finished withhis bidding.
He wants nothing of a god but eternityand a heaven to throne in.
SICINIUS
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
MENENIUS
I paint him in the character.
Mark what mercy hismother shall bring from him: there is no more mercyin him than there is milk in a male tiger; thatshall our poor city find: and all this is long ofyou.
SICINIUS
The gods be good unto us!
MENENIUS
No, in such a case the gods will not be good untous.
When we banished him, we respected not them;and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.
Messenger
Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:The plebeians have got your fellow-tribuneAnd hale him up and down, all swearing, ifThe Roman ladies bring not comfort home,They'll give him death by inches.
SICINIUS
What's the news?
Second Messenger
Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
SICINIUS
Friend,Art thou certain this is true?
is it most certain?Second Messenger
As certain as I know the sun is fire:Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,As the recomforted through the gates.
Why, hark you!The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,Make the sun dance.
Hark you!MENENIUS
This is good news:I will go meet the ladies.
This VolumniaIs worth of consuls, senators, patricians,A city full; of tribunes, such as you,A sea and land full.
You have pray'd well to-day:This morning for ten thousand of your throatsI'd not have given a doit.
Hark, how they joy!SICINIUS
First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,Accept my thankfulness.
Second Messenger
Sir, we have allGreat cause to give great thanks.
SICINIUS
They are near the city?
Second Messenger
Almost at point to enter.
SICINIUS
We will meet them,And help the joy.
