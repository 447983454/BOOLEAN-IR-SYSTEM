A plain in Denmark.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;Tell him that, by his licence, FortinbrasCraves the conveyance of a promised marchOver his kingdom.
You know the rendezvous.If that his majesty would aught with us,We shall express our duty in his eye;And let him know so.
Captain
I will do't, my lord.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Go softly on.
HAMLET
Good sir, whose powers are these?
Captain
They are of Norway, sir.
HAMLET
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Captain
Against some part of Poland.
HAMLET
Who commands them, sir?
Captain
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
HAMLET
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,Or for some frontier?
Captain
Truly to speak, and with no addition,We go to gain a little patch of groundThat hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;Nor will it yield to Norway or the PoleA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
HAMLET
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Captain
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
HAMLET
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducatsWill not debate the question of this straw:This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,That inward breaks, and shows no cause withoutWhy the man dies.
I humbly thank you, sir.Captain
God be wi' you, sir.
ROSENCRANTZ
Wilt please you go, my lord?
HAMLET
I'll be with you straight go a little before.
How all occasions do inform against me,And spur my dull revenge!
What is a man,If his chief good and market of his timeBe but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,Looking before and after, gave us notThat capability and god-like reasonTo fust in us unused.
Now, whether it beBestial oblivion, or some craven scrupleOf thinking too precisely on the event,A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdomAnd ever three parts coward, I do not knowWhy yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'Sith I have cause and will and strength and meansTo do't.
Examples gross as earth exhort me:Witness this army of such mass and chargeLed by a delicate and tender prince,Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'dMakes mouths at the invisible event,Exposing what is mortal and unsureTo all that fortune, death and danger dare,Even for an egg-shell.
Rightly to be greatIs not to stir without great argument,But greatly to find quarrel in a strawWhen honour's at the stake.
How stand I then,That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,Excitements of my reason and my blood,And let all sleep?
while, to my shame, I seeThe imminent death of twenty thousand men,That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plotWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,Which is not tomb enough and continentTo hide the slain?
O, from this time forth,My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
