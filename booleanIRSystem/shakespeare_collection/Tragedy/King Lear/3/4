The heath. Before a hovel.
KENT
Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:The tyranny of the open night's too roughFor nature to endure.
KING LEAR
Let me alone.
KENT
Good my lord, enter here.
KING LEAR
Wilt break my heart?
KENT
I had rather break mine own.
Good my lord, enter.KING LEAR
Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious stormInvades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;But where the greater malady is fix'd,The lesser is scarce felt.
Thou'ldst shun a bear;But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth.
When themind's free,The body's delicate: the tempest in my mindDoth from my senses take all feeling elseSave what beats there.
Filial ingratitude!Is it not as this mouth should tear this handFor lifting food to't?
But I will punish home:No, I will weep no more.
In such a nightTo shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
In such a night as this!
O Regan, Goneril!Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;No more of that.
KENT
Good my lord, enter here.
KING LEAR
Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:This tempest will not give me leave to ponderOn things would hurt me more.
But I'll go in.In, boy; go first.
You houseless poverty,--Nay, get thee in.
I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend youFrom seasons such as these?
O, I have ta'enToo little care of this!
Take physic, pomp;Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,And show the heavens more just.
EDGAR
[Within]  Fathom and half, fathom and half!
Poor Tom!Fool
Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spiritHelp me, help me!
KENT
Give me thy hand.
Who's there?Fool
A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.
KENT
What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
Come forth.
EDGAR
Away!
the foul fiend follows me!Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
KING LEAR
Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
And art thou come to this?
EDGAR
Who gives any thing to poor Tom?
whom the foulfiend hath led through fire and through flame, andthrough ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;that hath laid knives under his pillow, and haltersin his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made filmproud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse overfour-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for atraitor.
Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, dode, do de, do de.
Bless thee from whirlwinds,star-blasting, and taking!
Do poor Tom somecharity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could Ihave him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.
KING LEAR
What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
Couldst thou save nothing?
Didst thou give them all?Fool
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
KING LEAR
Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous airHang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
KENT
He hath no daughters, sir.
KING LEAR
Death, traitor!
nothing could have subdued natureTo such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
Is it the fashion, that discarded fathersShould have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Judicious punishment!
'twas this flesh begotThose pelican daughters.
EDGAR
Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!
Fool
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
EDGAR
Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not withman's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proudarray.
Tom's a-cold.KING LEAR
What hast thou been?
EDGAR
A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curledmy hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust ofmy mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness withher; swore as many oaths as I spake words, andbroke them in the sweet face of heaven: one thatslept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in womanout-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light ofear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling ofsilks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy footout of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy penfrom lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.
KING LEAR
Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answerwith thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
Is man no more than this? Consider him well.
Thouowest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheepno wool, the cat no perfume.
Ha! here's three on's are sophisticated!
Thou art the thing itself:unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,forked animal as thou art.
Off, off, you lendings!come unbutton here.
Fool
Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty nightto swim in.
Now a little fire in a wild field werelike an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all therest on's body cold.
Look, here comes a walking fire.EDGAR
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he beginsat curfew, and walks till the first cock; he givesthe web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes thehare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts thepoor creature of earth.
S.
Withold footed thrice the old;He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;Bid her alight,And her troth plight,And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
KENT
How fares your grace?
KING LEAR
What's he?
KENT
Who's there?
What is't you seek?GLOUCESTER
What are you there?
Your names?EDGAR
Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that inthe fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat andthe ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of thestanding pool; who is whipped from tithing totithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; whohath had three suits to his back, six shirts to hisbody, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;But mice and rats, and such small deer,Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
Beware my follower.
Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!GLOUCESTER
What, hath your grace no better company?
EDGAR
The prince of darkness is a gentleman:Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
GLOUCESTER
Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,That it doth hate what gets it.
EDGAR
Poor Tom's a-cold.
GLOUCESTER
Go in with me: my duty cannot sufferTo obey in all your daughters' hard commands:Though their injunction be to bar my doors,And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
KING LEAR
First let me talk with this philosopher.
What is the cause of thunder?
KENT
Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.
KING LEAR
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
What is your study?
EDGAR
How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.
KING LEAR
Let me ask you one word in private.
KENT
Importune him once more to go, my lord;His wits begin to unsettle.
GLOUCESTER
Canst thou blame him?
His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,I am almost mad myself: I had a son,Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,The grief hath crazed my wits.
What a night's this!I do beseech your grace,--KING LEAR
O, cry your mercy, sir.
Noble philosopher, your company.
EDGAR
Tom's a-cold.
GLOUCESTER
In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.
KING LEAR
Come let's in all.
KENT
This way, my lord.
KING LEAR
With him;I will keep still with my philosopher.
KENT
Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.
GLOUCESTER
Take him you on.
KENT
Sirrah, come on; go along with us.
KING LEAR
Come, good Athenian.
GLOUCESTER
No words, no words: hush.
EDGAR
      Child Rowland to the dark tower came,His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,I smell the blood of a British man.
