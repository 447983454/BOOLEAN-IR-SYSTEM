The heath.
EDGAR
Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,Than still contemn'd and flatter'd.
To be worst,The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:The lamentable change is from the best;The worst returns to laughter.
Welcome, then,Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worstOwes nothing to thy blasts.
But who comes here?My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,Lie would not yield to age.
Old Man
O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, andyour father's tenant, these fourscore years.
GLOUCESTER
Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:Thy comforts can do me no good at all;Thee they may hurt.
Old Man
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
GLOUCESTER
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,Our means secure us, and our mere defectsProve our commodities.
O dear son Edgar,The food of thy abused father's wrath!
Might I but live to see thee in my touch,I'ld say I had eyes again!
Old Man
How now!
Who's there?EDGAR
[Aside]  O gods!
Who is't can say 'I am atthe worst'?
I am worse than e'er I was.
Old Man
'Tis poor mad Tom.
EDGAR
[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is notSo long as we can say  'This is the worst.
'Old Man
Fellow, where goest?
GLOUCESTER
Is it a beggar-man?
Old Man
Madman and beggar too.
GLOUCESTER
He has some reason, else he could not beg.
I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;Which made me think a man a worm: my sonCame then into my mind; and yet my mindWas then scarce friends with him: I have heardmore since.
As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
They kill us for their sport.
EDGAR
[Aside]	How should this be?
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,Angering itself and others.
--Bless thee, master!GLOUCESTER
Is that the naked fellow?
Old Man
Ay, my lord.
GLOUCESTER
Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;And bring some covering for this naked soul,Who I'll entreat to lead me.
Old Man
Alack, sir, he is mad.
GLOUCESTER
'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;Above the rest, be gone.
Old Man
I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,Come on't what will.
GLOUCESTER
Sirrah, naked fellow,--EDGAR
Poor Tom's a-cold.
I cannot daub it further.
GLOUCESTER
Come hither, fellow.
EDGAR
[Aside]  And yet I must.
--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.GLOUCESTER
Know'st thou the way to Dover?
EDGAR
Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path.
PoorTom hath been scared out of his good wits: blessthee, good man's son, from the foul fiend!
fivefiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, asObidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, ofstealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, ofmopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaidsand waiting-women.
So, bless thee, master!GLOUCESTER
Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plaguesHave humbled to all strokes: that I am wretchedMakes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,That slaves your ordinance, that will not seeBecause he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;So distribution should undo excess,And each man have enough.
Dost thou know Dover?EDGAR
Ay, master.
GLOUCESTER
There is a cliff, whose high and bending headLooks fearfully in the confined deep:Bring me but to the very brim of it,And I'll repair the misery thou dost bearWith something rich about me: from that placeI shall no leading need.
EDGAR
Give me thy arm:Poor Tom shall lead thee.
