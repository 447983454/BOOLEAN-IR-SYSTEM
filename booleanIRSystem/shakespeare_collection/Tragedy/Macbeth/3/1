Forres. The palace.
BANQUO
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,As the weird women promised, and, I fear,Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was saidIt should not stand in thy posterity,But that myself should be the root and fatherOf many kings.
If there come truth from them--As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--Why, by the verities on thee made good,May they not be my oracles as well,And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.
MACBETH
Here's our chief guest.
LADY MACBETH
If he had been forgotten,It had been as a gap in our great feast,And all-thing unbecoming.
MACBETH
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,And I'll request your presence.
BANQUO
Let your highnessCommand upon me; to the which my dutiesAre with a most indissoluble tieFor ever knit.
MACBETH
Ride you this afternoon?
BANQUO
Ay, my good lord.
MACBETH
We should have else desired your good advice,Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
Is't far you ride?
BANQUO
As far, my lord, as will fill up the time'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,I must become a borrower of the nightFor a dark hour or twain.
MACBETH
Fail not our feast.
BANQUO
My lord, I will not.
MACBETH
We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'dIn England and in Ireland, not confessingTheir cruel parricide, filling their hearersWith strange invention: but of that to-morrow,When therewithal we shall have cause of stateCraving us jointly.
Hie you to horse: adieu,Till you return at night.
Goes Fleance with you?BANQUO
Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.
MACBETH
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;And so I do commend you to their backs.
Farewell.Let every man be master of his timeTill seven at night: to make societyThe sweeter welcome, we will keep ourselfTill supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those menOur pleasure?
ATTENDANT
They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
MACBETH
Bring them before us.
To be thus is nothing;But to be safely thus.
--Our fears in BanquoStick deep; and in his royalty of natureReigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valourTo act in safety.
There is none but heWhose being I do fear: and, under him,My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,Mark Antony's was by Caesar.
He chid the sistersWhen first they put the name of king upon me,And bade them speak to him: then prophet-likeThey hail'd him father to a line of kings:Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,No son of mine succeeding.
If 't be so,For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;Put rancours in the vessel of my peaceOnly for them; and mine eternal jewelGiven to the common enemy of man,To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come fate into the list.
And champion me to the utterance!
Who's there!Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
First Murderer
It was, so please your highness.
MACBETH
Well then, nowHave you consider'd of my speeches?
KnowThat it was he in the times past which held youSo under fortune, which you thought had beenOur innocent self: this I made good to youIn our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,the instruments,Who wrought with them, and all things else that mightTo half a soul and to a notion crazedSay 'Thus did Banquo.
'First Murderer
You made it known to us.
MACBETH
I did so, and went further, which is nowOur point of second meeting.
Do you findYour patience so predominant in your natureThat you can let this go?
Are you so gospell'dTo pray for this good man and for his issue,Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the graveAnd beggar'd yours for ever?
First Murderer
We are men, my liege.
MACBETH
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are cleptAll by the name of dogs: the valued fileDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,The housekeeper, the hunter, every oneAccording to the gift which bounteous natureHath in him closed; whereby he does receiveParticular addition.
from the billThat writes them all alike: and so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file,Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;And I will put that business in your bosoms,Whose execution takes your enemy off,Grapples you to the heart and love of us,Who wear our health but sickly in his life,Which in his death were perfect.
Second Murderer
I am one, my liege,Whom the vile blows and buffets of the worldHave so incensed that I am reckless whatI do to spite the world.
First Murderer
And I anotherSo weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,That I would set my lie on any chance,To mend it, or be rid on't.
MACBETH
Both of youKnow Banquo was your enemy.
Both Murderers
True, my lord.
MACBETH
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,That every minute of his being thrustsAgainst my near'st of life: and though I couldWith barefaced power sweep him from my sightAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,For certain friends that are both his and mine,Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fallWho I myself struck down; and thence it is,That I to your assistance do make love,Masking the business from the common eyeFor sundry weighty reasons.
Second Murderer
We shall, my lord,Perform what you command us.
First Murderer
Though our lives--MACBETH
Your spirits shine through you.
Within this hour at mostI will advise you where to plant yourselves;Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,And something from the palace; always thoughtThat I require a clearness: and with him--To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--Fleance his son, that keeps him company,Whose absence is no less material to meThan is his father's, must embrace the fateOf that dark hour.
Resolve yourselves apart:I'll come to you anon.
Both Murderers
We are resolved, my lord.
MACBETH
I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
It is concluded.
Banquo, thy soul's flight,If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.
