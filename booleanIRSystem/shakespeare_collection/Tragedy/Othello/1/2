Another street.
IAGO
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscienceTo do no contrived murder: I lack iniquitySometimes to do me service: nine or ten timesI had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
OTHELLO
'Tis better as it is.
IAGO
Nay, but he prated,And spoke such scurvy and provoking termsAgainst your honourThat, with the little godliness I have,I did full hard forbear him.
But, I pray you, sir,Are you fast married?
Be assured of this,That the magnifico is much beloved,And hath in his effect a voice potentialAs double as the duke's: he will divorce you;Or put upon you what restraint and grievanceThe law, with all his might to enforce it on,Will give him cable.
OTHELLO
Let him do his spite:My services which I have done the signioryShall out-tongue his complaints.
'Tis yet to know,--Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and beingFrom men of royal siege, and my demeritsMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortuneAs this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,But that I love the gentle Desdemona,I would not my unhoused free conditionPut into circumscription and confineFor the sea's worth.
But, look! what lights come yond?IAGO
Those are the raised father and his friends:You were best go in.
OTHELLO
Not I	I must be found:My parts, my title and my perfect soulShall manifest me rightly.
Is it they?IAGO
By Janus, I think no.
OTHELLO
The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
What is the news?
CASSIO
                  The duke does greet you, general,And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,Even on the instant.
OTHELLO
What is the matter, think you?
CASSIO
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:It is a business of some heat: the galleysHave sent a dozen sequent messengersThis very night at one another's heels,And many of the consuls, raised and met,Are at the duke's already: you have beenhotly call'd for;When, being not at your lodging to be found,The senate hath sent about three several guestsTo search you out.
OTHELLO
'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house,And go with you.
CASSIO
Ancient, what makes he here?
IAGO
'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.
CASSIO
I do not understand.
IAGO
He's married.
CASSIO
To who?
IAGO
Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?
OTHELLO
Have with you.
CASSIO
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
IAGO
It is Brabantio.
General, be advised;He comes to bad intent.
OTHELLO
Holla!
stand there!RODERIGO
Signior, it is the Moor.
BRABANTIO
Down with him, thief!
IAGO
You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.
OTHELLO
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
Good signior, you shall more command with yearsThan with your weapons.
BRABANTIO
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;For I'll refer me to all things of sense,If she in chains of magic were not bound,Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,So opposite to marriage that she shunnedThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,Would ever have, to incur a general mock,Run from her guardage to the sooty bosomOf such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in senseThat thou hast practised on her with foul charms,Abused her delicate youth with drugs or mineralsThat weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach theeFor an abuser of the world, a practiserOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,Subdue him at his peril.
OTHELLO
Hold your hands,Both you of my inclining, and the rest:Were it my cue to fight, I should have known itWithout a prompter.
Where will you that I goTo answer this your charge?
BRABANTIO
To prison, till fit timeOf law and course of direct sessionCall thee to answer.
OTHELLO
What if I do obey?
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,Whose messengers are here about my side,Upon some present business of the stateTo bring me to him?
First Officer
'Tis true, most worthy signior;The duke's in council and your noble self,I am sure, is sent for.
BRABANTIO
How!
the duke in council!In this time of the night!
Bring him away:Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,Or any of my brothers of the state,Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;For if such actions may have passage free,Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
