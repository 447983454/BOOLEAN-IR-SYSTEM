Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
COUNTESS
Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height ofyour breeding.
Clown
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: Iknow my business is but to the court.
COUNTESS
To the court!
why, what place make you special,when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
Clown
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, hemay easily put it off at court: he that cannot makea leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeedsuch a fellow, to say precisely, were not for thecourt; but for me, I have an answer will serve allmen.
COUNTESS
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits allquestions.
Clown
It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawnbuttock, or any buttock.
COUNTESS
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
Clown
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib'srush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for ShroveTuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to hishole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queento a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to thefriar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.
COUNTESS
Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for allquestions?
Clown
From below your duke to beneath your constable, itwill fit any question.
COUNTESS
It must be an answer of most monstrous size thatmust fit all demands.
Clown
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learnedshould speak truth of it: here it is, and all thatbelongs to't.
Ask me if I am a courtier: it shalldo you no harm to learn.
COUNTESS
To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool inquestion, hoping to be the wiser by your answer.
Ipray you, sir, are you a courtier?
Clown
O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off.
More,more, a hundred of them.
COUNTESS
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
Clown
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.
COUNTESS
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
Clown
O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
COUNTESS
You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.
Clown
O Lord, sir! spare not me.
COUNTESS
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!
' at your whipping, and'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!
' is verysequent to your whipping: you would answer very wellto a whipping, if you were but bound to't.
Clown
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
COUNTESS
I play the noble housewife with the timeTo entertain't so merrily with a fool.
Clown
O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.
COUNTESS
An end, sir; to your business.
Give Helen this,And urge her to a present answer back:Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:This is not much.
Clown
Not much commendation to them.
COUNTESS
Not much employment for you: you understand me?
Clown
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.
COUNTESS
Haste you again.
