Florence. The DUKE's palace.
DUKE
So that from point to point now have you heardThe fundamental reasons of this war,Whose great decision hath much blood let forthAnd more thirsts after.
First Lord
Holy seems the quarrelUpon your grace's part; black and fearfulOn the opposer.
DUKE
Therefore we marvel much our cousin FranceWould in so just a business shut his bosomAgainst our borrowing prayers.
Second Lord
Good my lord,The reasons of our state I cannot yield,But like a common and an outward man,That the great figure of a council framesBy self-unable motion: therefore dare notSay what I think of it, since I have foundMyself in my incertain grounds to failAs often as I guess'd.
DUKE
Be it his pleasure.
First Lord
But I am sure the younger of our nature,That surfeit on their ease, will day by dayCome here for physic.
DUKE
Welcome shall they be;And all the honours that can fly from usShall on them settle.
You know your places well;When better fall, for your avails they fell:To-morrow to the field.
