Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
COUNTESS
It hath happened all as I would have had it, savethat he comes not along with her.
Clown
By my troth, I take my young lord to be a verymelancholy man.
COUNTESS
By what observance, I pray you?
Clown
Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend theruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick histeeth and sing.
I know a man that had this trick ofmelancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
COUNTESS
Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
Clown
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: ourold ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothinglike your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin tolove, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
COUNTESS
What have we here?
Clown
E'en that you have there.
COUNTESS
[Reads]  I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hathrecovered the king, and undone me.
I have weddedher, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'eternal.
You shall hear I am run away: know itbefore the report come.
If there be breadth enoughin the world, I will hold a long distance.
My dutyto you.
Your unfortunate son,BERTRAM.
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
To fly the favours of so good a king;To pluck his indignation on thy headBy the misprising of a maid too virtuousFor the contempt of empire.
Clown
O madam, yonder is heavy news within between twosoldiers and my young lady!
COUNTESS
What is the matter?
Clown
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, somecomfort; your son will not be killed so soon as Ithought he would.
COUNTESS
Why should he be killed?
Clown
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss ofmen, though it be the getting of children.
Herethey come will tell you more: for my part, I onlyhear your son was run away.
First Gentleman
Save you, good madam.
HELENA
Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
Second Gentleman
Do not say so.
COUNTESS
Think upon patience.
Pray you, gentlemen,I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,That the first face of neither, on the start,Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?
Second Gentleman
Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:We met him thitherward; for thence we came,And, after some dispatch in hand at court,Thither we bend again.
HELENA
Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger whichnever shall come off, and show me a child begottenof thy body that I am father to, then call mehusband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.
'This is a dreadful sentence.
COUNTESS
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
First Gentleman
Ay, madam;And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.
COUNTESS
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;But I do wash his name out of my blood,And thou art all my child.
Towards Florence is he?Second Gentleman
Ay, madam.
COUNTESS
And to be a soldier?
Second Gentleman
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,The duke will lay upon him all the honourThat good convenience claims.
COUNTESS
Return you thither?
First Gentleman
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
HELENA
[Reads]  Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
'Tis bitter.
COUNTESS
Find you that there?
HELENA
Ay, madam.
First Gentleman
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which hisheart was not consenting to.
COUNTESS
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
There's nothing here that is too good for himBut only she; and she deserves a lordThat twenty such rude boys might tend uponAnd call her hourly mistress.
Who was with him?First Gentleman
A servant only, and a gentlemanWhich I have sometime known.
COUNTESS
Parolles, was it not?
First Gentleman
Ay, my good lady, he.
COUNTESS
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
My son corrupts a well-derived natureWith his inducement.
First Gentleman
Indeed, good lady,The fellow has a deal of that too much,Which holds him much to have.
COUNTESS
You're welcome, gentlemen.
I will entreat you, when you see my son,To tell him that his sword can never winThe honour that he loses: more I'll entreat youWritten to bear along.
Second Gentleman
We serve you, madam,In that and all your worthiest affairs.
COUNTESS
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
Will you draw near!
HELENA
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.
'Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;Then hast thou all again.
Poor lord! is't IThat chase thee from thy country and exposeThose tender limbs of thine to the eventOf the none-sparing war?
and is it IThat drive thee from the sportive court, where thouWast shot at with fair eyes, to be the markOf smoky muskets?
O you leaden messengers,That ride upon the violent speed of fire,Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;Whoever charges on his forward breast,I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;And, though I kill him not, I am the causeHis death was so effected: better 'twereI met the ravin lion when he roar'dWith sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twereThat all the miseries which nature owesWere mine at once.
No, come thou home, Rousillon,Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,As oft it loses all: I will be gone;My being here it is that holds thee hence:Shall I stay here to do't?
no, no, althoughThe air of paradise did fan the houseAnd angels officed all: I will be gone,That pitiful rumour may report my flight,To consolate thine ear.
Come, night; end, day!For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.
