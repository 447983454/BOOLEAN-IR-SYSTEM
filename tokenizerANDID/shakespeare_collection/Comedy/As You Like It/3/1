A room in the palace.
DUKE FREDERICK
Not see him since?
Sir, sir, that cannot be:But were I not the better part made mercy,I should not seek an absent argumentOf my revenge, thou present.
But look to it:Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;Seek him with candle; bring him dead or livingWithin this twelvemonth, or turn thou no moreTo seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thineWorth seizure do we seize into our hands,Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouthOf what we think against thee.
OLIVER
O that your highness knew my heart in this!
I never loved my brother in my life.
DUKE FREDERICK
More villain thou.
Well, push him out of doors;And let my officers of such a natureMake an extent upon his house and lands:Do this expediently and turn him going.
