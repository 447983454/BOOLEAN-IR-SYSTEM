The same.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spiritgrows melancholy?
MOTH
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
MOTH
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, mytender juvenal?
MOTH
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Why tough senior?
why tough senior?MOTH
Why tender juvenal?
why tender juvenal?DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epithetonappertaining to thy young days, which we maynominate tender.
MOTH
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to yourold time, which we may name tough.
DON ADRIANO DEARMADO
Pretty and apt.
MOTH
How mean you, sir?
I pretty, and my saying apt? orI apt, and my saying pretty?
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Thou pretty, because little.
MOTH
Little pretty, because little.
Wherefore apt?DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
And therefore apt, because quick.
MOTH
Speak you this in my praise, master?
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
In thy condign praise.
MOTH
I will praise an eel with the same praise.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
What, that an eel is ingenious?
MOTH
That an eel is quick.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
MOTH
I am answered, sir.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I love not to be crossed.
MOTH
[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I have promised to study three years with the duke.
MOTH
You may do it in an hour, sir.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Impossible.
MOTH
How many is one thrice told?
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
MOTH
You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I confess both: they are both the varnish of acomplete man.
MOTH
Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum ofdeuce-ace amounts to.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
It doth amount to one more than two.
MOTH
Which the base vulgar do call three.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
True.
MOTH
Why, sir, is this such a piece of study?
Now hereis three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and howeasy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' andstudy three years in two words, the dancing horsewill tell you.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
A most fine figure!
MOTH
To prove you a cipher.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it isbase for a soldier to love, so am I in love with abase wench.
If drawing my sword against the humourof affection would deliver me from the reprobatethought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, andransom him to any French courtier for a new-devisedcourtesy.
I think scorn to sigh: methinks I shouldoutswear Cupid.
Comfort, me, boy: what great menhave been in love?
MOTH
Hercules, master.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Most sweet Hercules!
More authority, dear boy, namemore; and, sweet my child, let them be men of goodrepute and carriage.
MOTH
Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, greatcarriage, for he carried the town-gates on his backlike a porter: and he was in love.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
O well-knit Samson!
strong-jointed Samson! I doexcel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me incarrying gates.
I am in love too. Who was Samson'slove, my dear Moth?
MOTH
A woman, master.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Of what complexion?
MOTH
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Tell me precisely of what complexion.
MOTH
Of the sea-water green, sir.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Is that one of the four complexions?
MOTH
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have alove of that colour, methinks Samson had small reasonfor it.
He surely affected her for her wit.MOTH
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
My love is most immaculate white and red.
MOTH
Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked undersuch colours.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Define, define, well-educated infant.
MOTH
My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty andpathetical!
MOTH
     If she be made of white and red,Her faults will ne'er be known,For blushing cheeks by faults are bredAnd fears by pale white shown:Then if she fear, or be to blame,By this you shall not know,For still her cheeks possess the sameWhich native she doth owe.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason ofwhite and red.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
MOTH
The world was very guilty of such a ballad somethree ages since: but I think now 'tis not to befound; or, if it were, it would neither serve forthe writing nor the tune.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I mayexample my digression by some mighty precedent.
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in thepark with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
MOTH
[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love thanmy master.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
MOTH
And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I say, sing.
MOTH
Forbear till this company be past.
DULL
Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costardsafe: and you must suffer him to take no delightnor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: sheis allowed for the day-woman.
Fare you well.DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I do betray myself with blushing.
Maid!JAQUENETTA
Man?
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I will visit thee at the lodge.
JAQUENETTA
That's hereby.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I know where it is situate.
JAQUENETTA
Lord, how wise you are!
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I will tell thee wonders.
JAQUENETTA
With that face?
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I love thee.
JAQUENETTA
So I heard you say.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
And so, farewell.
JAQUENETTA
Fair weather after you!
DULL
Come, Jaquenetta, away!
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thoube pardoned.
COSTARD
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on afull stomach.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Thou shalt be heavily punished.
COSTARD
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for theyare but lightly rewarded.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
Take away this villain; shut him up.
MOTH
Come, you transgressing slave; away!
COSTARD
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
MOTH
No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
COSTARD
Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolationthat I have seen, some shall see.
MOTH
What shall some see?
COSTARD
Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in theirwords; and therefore I will say nothing: I thankGod I have as little patience as another man; andtherefore I can be quiet.
DONADRIANO DE ARMADO
I do affect the very ground, which is base, whereher shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, whichis basest, doth tread.
I shall be forsworn, whichis a great argument of falsehood, if I love.
Andhow can that be true love which is falselyattempted?
Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:there is no evil angel but Love.
Yet was Samson sotempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet wasSolomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
The first and second cause will not serve my turn;the passado he respects not, the duello he regardsnot: his disgrace is to be called boy; but hisglory is to subdue men.
Adieu, valour! rust rapier!be still, drum!
for your manager is in love; yea,he loveth.
Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.
Devise, wit;write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.
