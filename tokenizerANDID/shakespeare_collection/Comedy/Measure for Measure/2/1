A hall In ANGELO's house.
ANGELO
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,And let it keep one shape, till custom make itTheir perch and not their terror.
ESCALUS
Ay, but yetLet us be keen, and rather cut a little,Than fall, and bruise to death.
Alas, this gentlemanWhom I would save, had a most noble father!
Let but your honour know,Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,That, in the working of your own affections,Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,Or that the resolute acting of your bloodCould have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,Whether you had not sometime in your lifeErr'd in this point which now you censure him,And pull'd the law upon you.
ANGELO
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,Another thing to fall.
I not deny,The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,May in the sworn twelve have a thief or twoGuiltier than him they try.
What's open made to justice,That justice seizes: what know the lawsThat thieves do pass on thieves?
'Tis very pregnant,The jewel that we find, we stoop and take'tBecause we see it; but what we do not seeWe tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offenceFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,When I, that censure him, do so offend,Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,And nothing come in partial.
Sir, he must die.ESCALUS
Be it as your wisdom will.
ANGELO
Where is the provost?
Provost
Here, if it like your honour.
ANGELO
See that ClaudioBe executed by nine to-morrow morning:Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
ESCALUS
[Aside]  Well, heaven forgive him!
and forgive us all!Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:And some condemned for a fault alone.
ELBOW
Come, bring them away: if these be good people ina commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses incommon houses, I know no law: bring them away.
ANGELO
How now, sir!
What's your name? and what's the matter?ELBOW
If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke'sconstable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean uponjustice, sir, and do bring in here before your goodhonour two notorious benefactors.
ANGELO
Benefactors?
Well; what benefactors are they? arethey not malefactors?
ELBOW
If it?
please your honour, I know not well what theyare: but precise villains they are, that I am sureof; and void of all profanation in the world thatgood Christians ought to have.
ESCALUS
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
ANGELO
Go to: what quality are they of?
Elbow is yourname?
why dost thou not speak, Elbow?POMPEY
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
ANGELO
What are you, sir?
ELBOW
He, sir!
a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one thatserves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as theysay, plucked down in the suburbs; and now sheprofesses a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
ESCALUS
How know you that?
ELBOW
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--ESCALUS
How?
thy wife?ELBOW
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--ESCALUS
Dost thou detest her therefore?
ELBOW
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well asshe, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
ESCALUS
How dost thou know that, constable?
ELBOW
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a womancardinally given, might have been accused infornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
ESCALUS
By the woman's means?
ELBOW
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as shespit in his face, so she defied him.
POMPEY
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
ELBOW
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourableman; prove it.
ESCALUS
Do you hear how he misplaces?
POMPEY
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;sir, we had but two in the house, which at that verydistant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, adish of some three-pence; your honours have seensuch dishes; they are not China dishes, but verygood dishes,--ESCALUS
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
POMPEY
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein inthe right: but to the point.
As I say, thisMistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, andbeing great-bellied, and longing, as I said, forprunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten therest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them veryhonestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I couldnot give you three-pence again.
FROTH
No, indeed.
POMPEY
Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--FROTH
Ay, so I did indeed.
POMPEY
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you beremembered, that such a one and such a one were pastcure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept verygood diet, as I told you,--FROTH
All this is true.
POMPEY
Why, very well, then,--ESCALUS
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose.
Whatwas done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause tocomplain of? Come me to what was done to her.
POMPEY
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
ESCALUS
No, sir, nor I mean it not.
POMPEY
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour'sleave.
And, I beseech you, look into Master Frothhere, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whosefather died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,Master Froth?
FROTH
All-hallond eve.
POMPEY
Why, very well; I hope here be truths.
He, sir,sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas inthe Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delightto sit, have you not?
FROTH
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
POMPEY
Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
ANGELO
This will last out a night in Russia,When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
ESCALUS
I think no less.
Good morrow to your lordship.Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
POMPEY
Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
ELBOW
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
POMPEY
I beseech your honour, ask me.
ESCALUS
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
POMPEY
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for agood purpose.
Doth your honour mark his face?ESCALUS
Ay, sir, very well.
POMPEY
Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.
ESCALUS
Well, I do so.
POMPEY
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
ESCALUS
Why, no.
POMPEY
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worstthing about him.
Good, then; if his face be theworst thing about him, how could Master Froth do theconstable's wife any harm?
I would know that ofyour honour.
ESCALUS
He's in the right.
Constable, what say you to it?ELBOW
First, an it like you, the house is a respectedhouse; next, this is a respected fellow; and hismistress is a respected woman.
POMPEY
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respectedperson than any of us all.
ELBOW
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet!
thetime has yet to come that she was ever respectedwith man, woman, or child.
POMPEY
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
ESCALUS
Which is the wiser here?
Justice or Iniquity? Isthis true?
ELBOW
O thou caitiff!
O thou varlet! O thou wickedHannibal!
I respected with her before I was marriedto her!
If ever I was respected with her, or shewith me, let not your worship think me the poorduke's officer.
Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, orI'll have mine action of battery on thee.
ESCALUS
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have youraction of slander too.
ELBOW
Marry, I thank your good worship for it.
What is'tyour worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
ESCALUS
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in himthat thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let himcontinue in his courses till thou knowest what theyare.
ELBOW
Marry, I thank your worship for it.
Thou seest, thouwicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou artto continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
ESCALUS
Where were you born, friend?
FROTH
Here in Vienna, sir.
ESCALUS
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
FROTH
Yes, an't please you, sir.
ESCALUS
So.
What trade are you of, sir?POMPHEY
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
ESCALUS
Your mistress' name?
POMPHEY
Mistress Overdone.
ESCALUS
Hath she had any more than one husband?
POMPEY
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
ESCALUS
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth.
MasterFroth, I would not have you acquainted withtapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and youwill hang them.
Get you gone, and let me hear nomore of you.
FROTH
I thank your worship.
For mine own part, I nevercome into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawnin.
ESCALUS
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Come you hither to me, Master tapster.
What's yourname, Master tapster?
POMPEY
Pompey.
ESCALUS
What else?
POMPEY
Bum, sir.
ESCALUS
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey theGreat.
Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are younot? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
POMPEY
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
ESCALUS
How would you live, Pompey?
by being a bawd? Whatdo you think of the trade, Pompey?
is it a lawful trade?POMPEY
If the law would allow it, sir.
ESCALUS
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shallnot be allowed in Vienna.
POMPEY
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all theyouth of the city?
ESCALUS
No, Pompey.
POMPEY
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
If your worship will take order for the drabs andthe knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
ESCALUS
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:it is but heading and hanging.
POMPEY
If you head and hang all that offend that way butfor ten year together, you'll be glad to give out acommission for more heads: if this law hold inVienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in itafter three-pence a bay: if you live to see thiscome to pass, say Pompey told you so.
ESCALUS
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of yourprophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not findyou before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewdCaesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shallhave you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
POMPEY
I thank your worship for your good counsel:but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shallbetter determine.
Whip me?
No, no; let carman whip his jade:The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.
ESCALUS
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Masterconstable.
How long have you been in this place of constable?ELBOW
Seven year and a half, sir.
ESCALUS
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you hadcontinued in it some time.
You say, seven years together?ELBOW
And a half, sir.
ESCALUS
Alas, it hath been great pains to you.
They do youwrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not menin your ward sufficient to serve it?
ELBOW
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as theyare chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; Ido it for some piece of money, and go through withall.
ESCALUS
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,the most sufficient of your parish.
ELBOW
To your worship's house, sir?
ESCALUS
To my house.
Fare you well.What's o'clock, think you?
Justice
Eleven, sir.
ESCALUS
I pray you home to dinner with me.
Justice
I humbly thank you.
ESCALUS
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;But there's no remedy.
Justice
Lord Angelo is severe.
ESCALUS
It is but needful:Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.
