How now, brother!
Where is my cousin, your son?hath he provided this music?
ANTONIO
He is very busy about it.
But, brother, I can tellyou strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
LEONATO
Are they good?
ANTONIO
As the event stamps them: but they have a goodcover; they show well outward.
The prince and CountClaudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mineorchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved myniece your daughter and meant to acknowledge itthis night in a dance: and if he found heraccordant, he meant to take the present time by thetop and instantly break with you of it.
LEONATO
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
ANTONIO
A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; andquestion him yourself.
LEONATO
No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appearitself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,that she may be the better prepared for an answer,if peradventure this be true.
Go you and tell her of it.Cousins, you know what you have to do.
O, I cry youmercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use yourskill.
Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
