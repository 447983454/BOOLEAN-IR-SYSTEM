The same.
LUCIANA
And may it be that you have quite forgotA husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:Let not my sister read it in your eye;Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bedAnd let her read it in thy looks at board:Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.
Alas, poor women!
make us but believe,Being compact of credit, that you love us;Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;We in your motion turn and you may move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--Less in your knowledge and your grace you show notThan our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
Against my soul's pure truth why labour youTo make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god?
would you create me new?Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
But if that I am I, then well I knowYour weeping sister is no wife of mine,Nor to her bed no homage do I oweFar more, far more to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,And in that glorious supposition thinkHe gains by death that hath such means to die:Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
LUCIANA
What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
LUCIANA
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
LUCIANA
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
LUCIANA
Why call you me love? call my sister so.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Thy sister's sister.
LUCIANA
That's my sister.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
No;It is thyself, mine own self's better part,Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.
LUCIANA
All this my sister is, or else should be.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
Give me thy hand.
LUCIANA
O, soft, air!
hold you still:I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Why, how now, Dromio!
where runn'st thou so fast?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Do you know me, sir?
am I Dromio? am I your man?am I myself?
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.
ANTIPHOLUS
What woman's man?
and how besides thyself? besides thyself?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; onethat claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
What claim lays she to thee?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to yourhorse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, Ibeing a beast, she would have me; but that she,being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
What is she?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man maynot speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.
' I havebut lean luck in the match, and yet is she awondrous fat marriage.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;and I know not what use to put her to but to make alamp of her and run from her by her own light.
Iwarrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn aPoland winter: if she lives till doomsday,she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
What complexion is she of?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half soclean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go overshoes in the grime of it.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
That's a fault that water will mend.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
What's her name?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that'san ell and three quarters, will not measure her fromhip to hip.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Then she bears some breadth?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:she is spherical, like a globe; I could find outcountries in her.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
In what part of her body stands Ireland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Where Scotland?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Where France?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
In her forehead; armed and reverted, making waragainst her heir.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Where England?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find nowhiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Where Spain?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Where America, the Indies?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished withrubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their richaspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent wholearmadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Oh, sir, I did not look so low.
To conclude, thisdrudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd meDromio; swore I was assured to her; told me whatprivy marks I had about me, as, the mark of myshoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on myleft arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:And, I think, if my breast had not been made offaith and my heart of steel,She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and mademe turn i' the wheel.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Go hie thee presently, post to the road:An if the wind blow any way from shore,I will not harbour in this town to-night:If any bark put forth, come to the mart,Where I will walk till thou return to me.
If every one knows us and we know none,'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
As from a bear a man would run for life,So fly I from her that would be my wife.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
There's none but witches do inhabit here;And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
She that doth call me husband, even my soulDoth for a wife abhor.
But her fair sister,Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,Of such enchanting presence and discourse,Hath almost made me traitor to myself:But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
ANGELO
Master Antipholus,--ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO
I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO
What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
Go home with it and please your wife withal;And soon at supper-time I'll visit youAnd then receive my money for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
I pray you, sir, receive the money now,For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
ANGELO
You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSE
What I should think of this, I cannot tell:But this I think, there's no man is so vainThat would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stayIf any ship put out, then straight away.
