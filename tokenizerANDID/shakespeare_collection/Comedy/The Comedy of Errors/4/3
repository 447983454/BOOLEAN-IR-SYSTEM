A public place.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
There's not a man I meet but doth salute meAs if I were their well-acquainted friend;And every one doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me; some invite me;Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;Some offer me commodities to buy:Even now a tailor call'd me in his shopAnd show'd me silks that he had bought for me,And therewithal took measure of my body.
Sure, these are but imaginary wilesAnd Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, here's the gold you sent me for.
What, haveyou got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What gold is this?
what Adam dost thou mean?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adamthat keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf'sskin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that camebehind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid youforsake your liberty.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I understand thee not.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No?
why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like abass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a soband 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayedmen and gives them suits of durance; he that sets uphis rest to do more exploits with his mace than amorris-pike.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What, thou meanest an officer?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that bringsany man to answer it that breaks his band; one thatthinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'Godgive you good rest!
'ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Well, sir, there rest in your foolery.
Is there anyDROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that thebark Expedition put forth to-night; and then wereyou hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoyDelay.
Here are the angels that you sent for todeliver you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
The fellow is distract, and so am I;And here we wander in illusions:Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
COURTEZAN
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:Is that the chain you promised me to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, is this Mistress Satan?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
It is the devil.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and hereshe comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereofcomes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's asmuch to say 'God make me a light wench.
' It iswritten, they appear to men like angels of light:light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;ergo, light wenches will burn.
Come not near her.COURTEZAN
Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
Will you go with me?
We'll mend our dinner here?DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak along spoon.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Why, Dromio?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat withthe devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Avoid then, fiend!
what tell'st thou me of supping?Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
COURTEZAN
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,A nut, a cherry-stone;But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
Master, be wise: an if you give it her,The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
COURTEZAN
I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.
COURTEZAN
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,Else would he never so demean himself.
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,And for the same he promised me a chain:Both one and other he denies me now.
The reason that I gather he is mad,Besides this present instance of his rage,Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,On purpose shut the doors against his way.
My way is now to hie home to his house,And tell his wife that, being lunatic,He rush'd into my house and took perforceMy ring away.
This course I fittest choose;For forty ducats is too much to lose.
