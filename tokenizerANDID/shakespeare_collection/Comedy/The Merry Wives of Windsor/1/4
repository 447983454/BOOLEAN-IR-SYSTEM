A room in DOCTOR CAIUS' house.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
What, John Rugby!
I pray thee, go to the casement,and see if you can see my master, Master DoctorCaius, coming.
If he do, i' faith, and find anybody in the house, here will be an old abusing ofGod's patience and the king's English.
RUGBY
I'll go watch.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, infaith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.
An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servantshall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, notell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,that he is given to prayer; he is something peevishthat way: but nobody but has his fault; but letthat pass.
Peter Simple, you say your name is?SIMPLE
Ay, for fault of a better.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
And Master Slender's your master?
SIMPLE
Ay, forsooth.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Does he not wear a great round beard, like aglover's paring-knife?
SIMPLE
No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with alittle yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
A softly-sprighted man, is he not?
SIMPLE
Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his handsas any is between this and his head; he hath foughtwith a warrener.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
How say you?
O, I should remember him: does he nothold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?
SIMPLE
Yes, indeed, does he.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune!
TellMaster Parson Evans I will do what I can for yourmaster: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--RUGBY
Out, alas! here comes my master.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
We shall all be shent.
Run in here, good young man;go into this closet: he will not stay long.
What, John Rugby!
John! what, John, I say!Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubthe be not well, that he comes not home.
And down, down, adown-a,  & c.
DOCTOR CAIUS

MISTRESS QUICKLY

DOCTOR CAIUS
