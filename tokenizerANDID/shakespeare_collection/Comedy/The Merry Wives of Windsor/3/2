A street.
MISTRESS PAGE
Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont tobe a follower, but now you are a leader.
Whetherhad you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?
ROBIN
I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a manthan follow him like a dwarf.
MISTRESS PAGE
O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a courtier.
FORD
Well met, Mistress Page.
Whither go you?MISTRESS PAGE
Truly, sir, to see your wife.
Is she at home?FORD
Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for wantof company.
I think, if your husbands were dead,you two would marry.
MISTRESS PAGE
Be sure of that,--two other husbands.
FORD
Where had you this pretty weather-cock?
MISTRESS PAGE
I cannot tell what the dickens his name is myhusband had him of.
What do you call your knight'sname, sirrah?
ROBIN
Sir John Falstaff.
FORD
Sir John Falstaff!
MISTRESS PAGE
He, he; I can never hit on's name.
There is such aleague between my good man and he!
Is your wife athome indeed?
FORD
Indeed she is.
MISTRESS PAGE
By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.
FORD
Has Page any brains?
hath he any eyes? hath he anythinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, aseasy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelvescore.
He pieces out his wife's inclination; hegives her folly motion and advantage: and now she'sgoing to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her.
Aman may hear this shower sing in the wind.
AndFalstaff's boy with her!
Good plots, they are laid;and our revolted wives share damnation together.
Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluckthe borrowed veil of modesty from the so seemingMistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure andwilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings allmy neighbours shall cry aim.
The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids mesearch: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall berather praised for this than mocked; for it is aspositive as the earth is firm that Falstaff isthere: I will go.

& C
Well met, Master Ford.
FORD
Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;and I pray you all go with me.
SHALLOW
I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
SLENDER
And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine withMistress Anne, and I would not break with her formore money than I'll speak of.
SHALLOW
We have lingered about a match between Anne Page andmy cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.
SLENDER
I hope I have your good will, father Page.
PAGE
You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.
DOCTOR CAIUS
Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-aQuickly tell me so mush.
Host
What say you to young Master Fenton?
he capers, hedances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, hespeaks holiday, he smells April and May: he willcarry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; hewill carry't.
PAGE
Not by my consent, I promise you.
The gentleman isof no having: he kept company with the wild princeand Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows toomuch.
No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortuneswith the finger of my substance: if he take her,let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits onmy consent, and my consent goes not that way.
FORD
I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with meto dinner: besides your cheer, you shall havesport; I will show you a monster.
Master doctor,you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.
SHALLOW
Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooingat Master Page's.
DOCTOR CAIUS
Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.
Host
Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knightFalstaff, and drink canary with him.
FORD
[Aside]  I think I shall drink in pipe wine firstwith him; I'll make him dance.
Will you go, gentles?All
Have with you to see this monster.
