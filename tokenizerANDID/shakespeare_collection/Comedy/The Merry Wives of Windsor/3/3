A room in FORD'S house.
MISTRESS FORD
What, John!
What, Robert!MISTRESS PAGE
Quickly, quickly!
is the buck-basket--MISTRESS FORD
I warrant.
What, Robin, I say!MISTRESS PAGE
Come, come, come.
MISTRESS FORD
Here, set it down.
MISTRESS PAGE
Give your men the charge; we must be brief.
MISTRESS FORD
Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, beready here hard by in the brew-house: and when Isuddenly call you, come forth, and without any pauseor staggering take this basket on your shoulders:that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carryit among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and thereempty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.
MISTRESS PAGE
You will do it?
MISTRESS FORD
I ha' told them over and over; they lack nodirection.
Be gone, and come when you are called.MISTRESS PAGE
Here comes little Robin.
MISTRESS FORD
How now, my eyas-musket!
what news with you?ROBIN
My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
MISTRESS PAGE
You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?
ROBIN
Ay, I'll be sworn.
My master knows not of yourbeing here and hath threatened to put me intoeverlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for heswears he'll turn me away.
MISTRESS PAGE
Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall bea tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doubletand hose.
I'll go hide me.MISTRESS FORD
Do so.
Go tell thy master I am alone.Mistress Page, remember you your cue.
MISTRESS PAGE
I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.
MISTRESS FORD
Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to knowturtles from jays.
FALSTAFF
Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?
Why, now letme die, for I have lived long enough: this is theperiod of my ambition: O this blessed hour!
MISTRESS FORD
O sweet Sir John!
FALSTAFF
Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,Mistress Ford.
Now shall I sin in my wish: I wouldthy husband were dead: I'll speak it before thebest lord; I would make thee my lady.
MISTRESS FORD
I your lady, Sir John!
alas, I should be a pitiful lady!FALSTAFF
Let the court of France show me such another.
I seehow thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hastthe right arched beauty of the brow that becomes theship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire ofVenetian admittance.
MISTRESS FORD
A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothingelse; nor that well neither.
FALSTAFF
By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thouwouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firmfixture of thy foot would give an excellent motionto thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale.
I seewhat thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Naturethy friend.
Come, thou canst not hide it.MISTRESS FORD
Believe me, there is no such thing in me.
FALSTAFF
What made me love thee?
let that persuade theethere's something extraordinary in thee.
Come, Icannot cog and say thou art this and that, like amany of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come likewomen in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersburyin simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; nonebut thee; and thou deservest it.
MISTRESS FORD
Do not betray me, sir.
I fear you love Mistress Page.FALSTAFF
Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by theCounter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reekof a lime-kiln.
MISTRESS FORD
Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall oneday find it.
FALSTAFF
Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.
MISTRESS FORD
Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could notbe in that mind.
ROBIN
[Within]  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford!
here'sMistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing andlooking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.
FALSTAFF
She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.
MISTRESS FORD
Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.
What's the matter? how now!
MISTRESS PAGE
O Mistress Ford, what have you done?
You're shamed,you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
MISTRESS FORD
What's the matter, good Mistress Page?
MISTRESS PAGE
O well-a-day, Mistress Ford!
having an honest manto your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!
MISTRESS FORD
What cause of suspicion?
MISTRESS PAGE
What cause of suspicion!
Out pon you! how am Imistook in you!
MISTRESS FORD
Why, alas, what's the matter?
MISTRESS PAGE
Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all theofficers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman thathe says is here now in the house by your consent, totake an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.
MISTRESS FORD
'Tis not so, I hope.
MISTRESS PAGE
Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a manhere!
but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such aone.
I come before to tell you. If you knowyourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if youhave a friend here convey, convey him out.
Be notamazed; call all your senses to you; defend yourreputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.
MISTRESS FORD
What shall I do?
There is a gentleman my dearfriend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as hisperil: I had rather than a thousand pound he wereout of the house.
MISTRESS PAGE
For shame!
never stand 'you had rather' and 'youhad rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethinkyou of some conveyance: in the house you cannothide him.
O, how have you deceived me! Look, hereis a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, hemay creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, asif it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.
MISTRESS FORD
He's too big to go in there.
What shall I do?FALSTAFF
[Coming forward]  Let me see't, let me see't, O, letme see't! I'll in, I'll in.
Follow your friend'scounsel.
I'll in.MISTRESS PAGE
What, Sir John Falstaff!
Are these your letters, knight?FALSTAFF
I love thee.
Help me away. Let me creep in here.I'll never--MISTRESS PAGE
Help to cover your master, boy.
Call your men,Mistress Ford.
You dissembling knight!MISTRESS FORD
What, John!
Robert! John!Go take up these clothes here quickly.
Where's thecowl-staff? look, how you drumble!
Carry them tothe laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.
FORD
Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;I deserve it.
How now! whither bear you this?Servant
To the laundress, forsooth.
MISTRESS FORD
Why, what have you to do whither they bear it?
Youwere best meddle with buck-washing.
FORD
Buck!
I would I could wash myself of the buck!Buck, buck, buck!
Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;and of the season too, it shall appear.
Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you mydream.
Here, here, here be my keys: ascend mychambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrantwe'll unkennel the fox.
Let me stop this way first.So, now uncape.
PAGE
Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.
FORD
True, Master Page.
Up, gentlemen: you shall seesport anon: follow me, gentlemen.
SIR HUGH EVANS
This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.
DOCTOR CAIUS
By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is notjealous in France.
PAGE
Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.
MISTRESS PAGE
Is there not a double excellency in this?
MISTRESS FORD
I know not which pleases me better, that my husbandis deceived, or Sir John.
MISTRESS PAGE
What a taking was he in when your husband asked whowas in the basket!
MISTRESS FORD
I am half afraid he will have need of washing; sothrowing him into the water will do him a benefit.
MISTRESS PAGE
Hang him, dishonest rascal!
I would all of the samestrain were in the same distress.
MISTRESS FORD
I think my husband hath some special suspicion ofFalstaff's being here; for I never saw him so grossin his jealousy till now.
MISTRESS PAGE
I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet havemore tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease willscarce obey this medicine.
MISTRESS FORD
Shall we send that foolish carrion, MistressQuickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into thewater; and give him another hope, to betray him toanother punishment?
MISTRESS PAGE
We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,eight o'clock, to have amends.
FORD
I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of thathe could not compass.
MISTRESS PAGE
[Aside to MISTRESS FORD]  Heard you that?
MISTRESS FORD
You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
FORD
Ay, I do so.
MISTRESS FORD
Heaven make you better than your thoughts!
FORD
Amen!
MISTRESS PAGE
You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.
FORD
Ay, ay; I must bear it.
SIR HUGH EVANS
If there be any pody in the house, and in thechambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!
DOCTOR CAIUS
By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.
PAGE
Fie, fie, Master Ford!
are you not ashamed? Whatspirit, what devil suggests this imagination?
Iwould not ha' your distemper in this kind for thewealth of Windsor Castle.
FORD
'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.
SIR HUGH EVANS
You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is ashonest a 'omans as I will desires among fivethousand, and five hundred too.
DOCTOR CAIUS
By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.
FORD
Well, I promised you a dinner.
Come, come, walk inthe Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereaftermake known to you why I have done this.
Come,wife; come, Mistress Page.
I pray you, pardon me;pray heartily, pardon me.
PAGE
Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mockhim.
I do invite you to-morrow morning to my houseto breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together; Ihave a fine hawk for the bush.
Shall it be so?FORD
Any thing.
SIR HUGH EVANS
If there is one, I shall make two in the company.
DOCTOR CAIUS
If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.
FORD
Pray you, go, Master Page.
SIR HUGH EVANS
I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousyknave, mine host.
DOCTOR CAIUS
Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!
SIR HUGH EVANS
A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!
