A road near the Shepherd's cottage.
AUTOLYCUS
When daffodils begin to peer,With heigh!
the doxy over the dale,Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,With heigh!
the sweet birds, O, how they sing!Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,With heigh!
with heigh! the thrush and the jay,Are summer songs for me and my aunts,While we lie tumbling in the hay.
I have served Prince Florizel and in my timewore three-pile; but now I am out of service:But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
The pale moon shines by night:And when I wander here and there,I then do most go right.
If tinkers may have leave to live,And bear the sow-skin budget,Then my account I well may, give,And in the stocks avouch it.
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look tolesser linen.
My father named me Autolycus; whobeing, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewisea snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.
With die anddrab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue isthe silly cheat.
Gallows and knock are too powerfulon the highway: beating and hanging are terrors tome: for the life to come, I sleep out the thoughtof it.
A prize! a prize!Clown
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every todyields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundredshorn.
what comes the wool to?AUTOLYCUS
[Aside]If the springe hold, the cock's mine.
Clown
I cannot do't without counters.
Let me see; what amI to buy for our sheep-shearing feast?
Three poundof sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what willthis sister of mine do with rice?
But my fatherhath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays iton.
She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays forthe shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very goodones; but they are most of them means and bases; butone puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms tohorn-pipes.
I must have saffron to colour the wardenpies; mace; dates?
--none, that's out of my note;nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that Imay beg; four pound of prunes, and as many ofraisins o' the sun.
AUTOLYCUS
O that ever I was born!
Clown
I' the name of me--AUTOLYCUS
O, help me, help me!
pluck but off these rags; andthen, death, death!
Clown
Alack, poor soul!
thou hast need of more rags to layon thee, rather than have these off.
AUTOLYCUS
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me morethan the stripes I have received, which are mightyones and millions.
Clown
Alas, poor man!
a million of beating may come to agreat matter.
AUTOLYCUS
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparelta'en from me, and these detestable things put uponme.
Clown
What, by a horseman, or a footman?
AUTOLYCUS
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
Clown
Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments hehas left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,it hath seen very hot service.
Lend me thy hand,I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.
AUTOLYCUS
O, good sir, tenderly, O!
Clown
Alas, poor soul!
AUTOLYCUS
O, good sir, softly, good sir!
I fear, sir, myshoulder-blade is out.
Clown
How now!
canst stand?AUTOLYCUS
[Picking his pocket]Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly.
You ha' done mea charitable office.
Clown
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
AUTOLYCUS
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I havea kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, orany thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;that kills my heart.
Clown
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
AUTOLYCUS
A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about withtroll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of theprince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of hisvirtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.
Clown
His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whippedout of the court: they cherish it to make it staythere; and yet it will no more but abide.
AUTOLYCUS
Vices, I would say, sir.
I know this man well: hehath been since an ape-bearer; then aprocess-server, a bailiff; then he compassed amotion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker'swife within a mile where my land and living lies;and, having flown over many knavish professions, hesettled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
Clown
Out upon him!
prig, for my life, prig: he hauntswakes, fairs and bear-baitings.
AUTOLYCUS
Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue thatput me into this apparel.
Clown
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you hadbut looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.
AUTOLYCUS
I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I amfalse of heart that way; and that he knew, I warranthim.
Clown
How do you now?
AUTOLYCUS
Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand andwalk: I will even take my leave of you, and pacesoftly towards my kinsman's.
Clown
Shall I bring thee on the way?
AUTOLYCUS
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.
Clown
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for oursheep-shearing.
AUTOLYCUS
Prosper you, sweet sir!
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if Imake not this cheat bring out another and theshearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my nameput in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,And merrily hent the stile-a:A merry heart goes all the day,Your sad tires in a mile-a.
