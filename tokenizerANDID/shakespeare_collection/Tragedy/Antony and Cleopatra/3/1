A plain in Syria.
VENTIDIUS
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and nowPleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' deathMake me revenger.
Bear the king's son's bodyBefore our army.
Thy Pacorus, Orodes,Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
SILIUS
Noble Ventidius,Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,Mesopotamia, and the shelters whitherThe routed fly: so thy grand captain AntonyShall set thee on triumphant chariots andPut garlands on thy head.
VENTIDIUS
O Silius, Silius,I have done enough; a lower place, note well,May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;Better to leave undone, than by our deedAcquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
Caesar and Antony have ever wonMore in their officer than person: Sossius,One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,For quick accumulation of renown,Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
Who does i' the wars more than his captain canBecomes his captain's captain: and ambition,The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,But 'twould offend him; and in his offenceShould my performance perish.
SILIUS
Thou hast, Ventidius,thatWithout the which a soldier, and his sword,Grants scarce distinction.
Thou wilt write to Antony!VENTIDIUS
I'll humbly signify what in his name,That magical word of war, we have effected;How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of ParthiaWe have jaded out o' the field.
SILIUS
Where is he now?
VENTIDIUS
He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what hasteThe weight we must convey with's will permit,We shall appear before him.
On there; pass along!
