OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
First Soldier
If we be not relieved within this hour,We must return to the court of guard: the nightIs shiny; and they say we shall embattleBy the second hour i' the morn.
Second Soldier
This last day wasA shrewd one to's.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
                  O, bear me witness, night,--Third Soldier
What man is this?
Second Soldier
Stand close, and list him.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,When men revolted shall upon recordBear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus didBefore thy face repent!
First Soldier
Enobarbus!
Third Soldier
Peace!
Hark further.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,That life, a very rebel to my will,May hang no longer on me: throw my heartAgainst the flint and hardness of my fault:Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,And finish all foul thoughts.
O Antony,Nobler than my revolt is infamous,Forgive me in thine own particular;But let the world rank me in registerA master-leaver and a fugitive:O Antony!
O Antony!Second Soldier
Let's speak To him.
First Soldier
Let's hear him, for the things he speaksMay concern Caesar.
Third Soldier
Let's do so.
But he sleeps.First Soldier
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as hisWas never yet for sleep.
Second Soldier
Go we to him.
Third Soldier
Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
Second Soldier
Hear you, sir?
First Soldier
The hand of death hath raught him.
Hark!
the drumsDemurely wake the sleepers.
Let us bear himTo the court of guard; he is of note: our hourIs fully out.
Third Soldier
Come on, then;He may recover yet.
