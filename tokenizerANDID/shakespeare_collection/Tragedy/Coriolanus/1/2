Corioli. The Senate-house.
First Senator
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,That they of Rome are entered in our counselsAnd know how we proceed.
AUFIDIUS
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,That could be brought to bodily act ere RomeHad circumvention?
'Tis not four days goneSince I heard thence; these are the words: I thinkI have the letter here; yes, here it is.
'They have press'd a power, but it is not knownWhether for east or west: the dearth is great;The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,These three lead on this preparationWhither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:Consider of it.
'First Senator
                  Our army's in the fieldWe never yet made doubt but Rome was readyTo answer us.
AUFIDIUS
                  Nor did you think it follyTo keep your great pretences veil'd till whenThey needs must show themselves; whichin the hatching,It seem'd, appear'd to Rome.
By the discovery.We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which wasTo take in many towns ere almost RomeShould know we were afoot.
Second Senator
Noble Aufidius,Take your commission; hie you to your bands:Let us alone to guard Corioli:If they set down before 's, for the removeBring your army; but, I think, you'll findThey've not prepared for us.
AUFIDIUS
O, doubt not that;I speak from certainties.
Nay, more,Some parcels of their power are forth already,And only hitherward.
I leave your honours.If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strikeTill one can do no more.
All
The gods assist you!
AUFIDIUS
And keep your honours safe!
First Senator
Farewell.
Second Senator
Farewell.
All
Farewell.
