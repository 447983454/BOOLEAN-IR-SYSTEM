Rome. A street.
CORIOLANUS
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
LARTIUS
He had, my lord; and that it was which causedOur swifter composition.
CORIOLANUS
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again.
COMINIUS
They are worn, lord consul, so,That we shall hardly in our ages seeTheir banners wave again.
CORIOLANUS
Saw you Aufidius?
LARTIUS
On safe-guard he  came to me; and did curseAgainst the Volsces, for they had so vilelyYielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
CORIOLANUS
Spoke he of me?
LARTIUS
He did, my lord.
CORIOLANUS
How?
what?LARTIUS
How often he had met you, sword to sword;That of all things upon the earth he hatedYour person most, that he would pawn his fortunesTo hopeless restitution, so he mightBe call'd your vanquisher.
CORIOLANUS
At Antium lives he?
LARTIUS
At Antium.
CORIOLANUS
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,To oppose his hatred fully.
Welcome home.Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;For they do prank them in authority,Against all noble sufferance.
SICINIUS
Pass no further.
CORIOLANUS
Ha!
what is that?BRUTUS
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
CORIOLANUS
What makes this change?
MENENIUS
The matter?
COMINIUS
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
BRUTUS
Cominius, no.
CORIOLANUS
Have I had children's voices?
First Senator
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
BRUTUS
The people are incensed against him.
SICINIUS
Stop,Or all will fall in broil.
CORIOLANUS
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them nowAnd straight disclaim their tongues?
What areyour offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?
MENENIUS
Be calm, be calm.
CORIOLANUS
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,To curb the will of the nobility:Suffer't, and live with such as cannot ruleNor ever will be ruled.
BRUTUS
Call't not a plot:The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,When corn was given them gratis, you repined;Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd themTime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
CORIOLANUS
Why, this was known before.
BRUTUS
Not to them all.
CORIOLANUS
Have you inform'd them sithence?
BRUTUS
How!
I inform them!CORIOLANUS
You are like to do such business.
BRUTUS
Not unlike,Each way, to better yours.
CORIOLANUS
Why then should I be consul?
By yond clouds,Let me deserve so ill as you, and make meYour fellow tribune.
SICINIUS
You show too much of thatFor which the people stir: if you will passTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,Or never be so noble as a consul,Nor yoke with him for tribune.
MENENIUS
Let's be calm.
COMINIUS
The people are abused; set on.
This palteringBecomes not Rome, nor has CoriolanusDeserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falselyI' the plain way of his merit.
CORIOLANUS
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--MENENIUS
Not now, not now.
First Senator
Not in this heat, sir, now.
CORIOLANUS
Now, as I live, I will.
My nobler friends,I crave their pardons:For the mutable, rank-scented many, let themRegard me as I do not flatter, andTherein behold themselves: I say again,In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senateThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,and scatter'd,By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but thatWhich they have given to beggars.
MENENIUS
Well, no more.
First Senator
No more words, we beseech you.
CORIOLANUS
How!
no more!As for my country I have shed my blood,Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungsCoin words till their decay against those measles,Which we disdain should tatter us, yet soughtThe very way to catch them.
BRUTUS
You speak o' the people,As if you were a god to punish, notA man of their infirmity.
SICINIUS
'Twere wellWe let the people know't.
MENENIUS
What, what?
his choler?CORIOLANUS
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
SICINIUS
It is a mindThat shall remain a poison where it is,Not poison any further.
CORIOLANUS
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
mark youHis absolute 'shall'?
COMINIUS
'Twas from the canon.
CORIOLANUS
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians!
why,You grave but reckless senators, have you thusGiven Hydra here to choose an officer,That with his peremptory 'shall,' being butThe horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spiritTo say he'll turn your current in a ditch,And make your channel his?
If he have powerThen vail your ignorance; if none, awakeYour dangerous lenity.
If you are learn'd,Be not as common fools; if you are not,Let them have cushions by you.
You are plebeians,If they be senators: and they are no less,When, both your voices blended, the great'st tasteMost palates theirs.
They choose their magistrate,And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'His popular 'shall' against a graver benchThan ever frown in Greece.
By Jove himself!It makes the consuls base: and my soul achesTo know, when two authorities are up,Neither supreme, how soon confusionMay enter 'twixt the gap of both and takeThe one by the other.
COMINIUS
Well, on to the market-place.
CORIOLANUS
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forthThe corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas usedSometime in Greece,--MENENIUS
Well, well, no more of that.
CORIOLANUS
Though there the people had more absolute power,I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fedThe ruin of the state.
BRUTUS
Why, shall the people giveOne that speaks thus their voice?
CORIOLANUS
I'll give my reasons,More worthier than their voices.
They know the cornWas not our recompense, resting well assuredThat ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,They would not thread the gates.
This kind of serviceDid not deserve corn gratis.
Being i' the warTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'dMost valour, spoke not for them: the accusationWhich they have often made against the senate,All cause unborn, could never be the motiveOf our so frank donation.
Well, what then?How shall this bisson multitude digestThe senate's courtesy?
Let deeds expressWhat's like to be their words: 'we did request it;We are the greater poll, and in true fearThey gave us our demands.
' Thus we debaseThe nature of our seats and make the rabbleCall our cares fears; which will in timeBreak ope the locks o' the senate and bring inThe crows to peck the eagles.
MENENIUS
Come, enough.
BRUTUS
Enough, with over-measure.
CORIOLANUS
No, take more:What may be sworn by, both divine and human,Seal what I end withal!
This double worship,Where one part does disdain with cause, the otherInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,Cannot conclude but by the yea and noOf general ignorance,--it must omitReal necessities, and give way the whileTo unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,it follows,Nothing is done to purpose.
Therefore, beseech you,--You that will be less fearful than discreet,That love the fundamental part of stateMore than you doubt the change on't, that preferA noble life before a long, and wishTo jump a body with a dangerous physicThat's sure of death without it, at once pluck outThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lickThe sweet which is their poison: your dishonourMangles true judgment and bereaves the stateOf that integrity which should become't,Not having the power to do the good it would,For the in which doth control't.
BRUTUS
Has said enough.
SICINIUS
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answerAs traitors do.
CORIOLANUS
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
On whom depending, their obedience failsTo the greater bench: in a rebellion,When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,Then were they chosen: in a better hour,Let what is meet be said it must be meet,And throw their power i' the dust.
BRUTUS
Manifest treason!
SICINIUS
This a consul? no.
BRUTUS
The aediles, ho!
Let him be apprehended.
SICINIUS
Go, call the people:in whose name myselfAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,And follow to thine answer.
CORIOLANUS
Hence, old goat!
Senators,  & C	We'll surety him.
COMINIUS
Aged sir, hands off.
CORIOLANUS
Hence, rotten thing!
or I shall shake thy bonesOut of thy garments.
SICINIUS
Help, ye citizens!
MENENIUS
On both sides more respect.
SICINIUS
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
BRUTUS
Seize him, AEdiles!
Citizens
Down with him!
down with him!Senators,  & C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!
'Tribunes!
' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!''Sicinius!
' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!''Peace, peace, peace!
' 'Stay, hold, peace!'MENENIUS
What is about to be?
I am out of breath;Confusion's near; I cannot speak.
You, tribunesTo the people!
Coriolanus, patience!Speak, good Sicinius.
SICINIUS
Hear me, people; peace!
Citizens
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
SICINIUS
You are at point to lose your liberties:Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,Whom late you have named for consul.
MENENIUS
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
First Senator
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
SICINIUS
What is the city but the people?
Citizens
True,The people are the city.
BRUTUS
By the consent of all, we were establish'dThe people's magistrates.
Citizens
You so remain.
MENENIUS
And so are like to do.
COMINIUS
That is the way to lay the city flat;To bring the roof to the foundation,And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,In heaps and piles of ruin.
SICINIUS
This deserves death.
BRUTUS
Or let us stand to our authority,Or let us lose it.
We do here pronounce,Upon the part o' the people, in whose powerWe were elected theirs, Marcius is worthyOf present death.
SICINIUS
                  Therefore lay hold of him;Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thenceInto destruction cast him.
BRUTUS
AEdiles, seize him!
Citizens
Yield, Marcius, yield!
MENENIUS
Hear me one word;Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
AEdile
Peace, peace!
MENENIUS
[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly yourcountry's friend,And temperately proceed to what you wouldThus violently redress.
BRUTUS
Sir, those cold ways,That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonousWhere the disease is violent.
Lay hands upon him,And bear him to the rock.
CORIOLANUS
No, I'll die here.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
MENENIUS
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
BRUTUS
Lay hands upon him.
COMINIUS
Help Marcius, help,You that be noble; help him, young and old!
Citizens
Down with him, down with him!
MENENIUS
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.
Second Senator
Get you gone.
COMINIUS
Stand fast;We have as many friends as enemies.
MENENIUS
Sham it be put to that?
First Senator
The gods forbid!
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;Leave us to cure this cause.
MENENIUS
For 'tis a sore upon us,You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
COMINIUS
Come, sir, along with us.
CORIOLANUS
I would they were barbarians--as they are,Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--MENENIUS
Be gone;Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;One time will owe another.
CORIOLANUS
On fair groundI could beat forty of them.
COMINIUS
I could myselfTake up a brace o' the best of them; yea, thetwo tribunes:But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;And manhood is call'd foolery, when it standsAgainst a falling fabric.
Will you hence,Before the tag return?
whose rage doth rendLike interrupted waters and o'erbearWhat they are used to bear.
MENENIUS
Pray you, be gone:I'll try whether my old wit be in requestWith those that have but little: this must be patch'dWith cloth of any colour.
COMINIUS
Nay, come away.
A Patrician
This man has marr'd his fortune.
MENENIUS
His nature is too noble for the world:He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,Or Jove for's power to thunder.
His heart's his mouth:What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;And, being angry, does forget that everHe heard the name of death.
Here's goodly work!
Second Patrician
I would they were abed!
MENENIUS
I would they were in Tiber!
What the vengeance!Could he not speak 'em fair?
SICINIUS
Where is this viperThat would depopulate the city andBe every man himself?
MENENIUS
You worthy tribunes,--SICINIUS
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rockWith rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,And therefore law shall scorn him further trialThan the severity of the public powerWhich he so sets at nought.
First Citizen
He shall well knowThe noble tribunes are the people's mouths,And we their hands.
Citizens
He shall, sure on't.
MENENIUS
Sir, sir,--SICINIUS
Peace!
MENENIUS
Do not cry havoc, where you should but huntWith modest warrant.
SICINIUS
Sir, how comes't that youHave holp to make this rescue?
MENENIUS
Hear me speak:As I do know the consul's worthiness,So can I name his faults,--SICINIUS
Consul!
what consul?MENENIUS
The consul Coriolanus.
BRUTUS
He consul!
Citizens
No, no, no, no, no.
MENENIUS
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;The which shall turn you to no further harmThan so much loss of time.
SICINIUS
Speak briefly then;For we are peremptory to dispatchThis viperous traitor: to eject him henceWere but one danger, and to keep him hereOur certain death: therefore it is decreedHe dies to-night.
MENENIUS
                  Now the good gods forbidThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitudeTowards her deserved children is enroll'dIn Jove's own book, like an unnatural damShould now eat up her own!
SICINIUS
He's a disease that must be cut away.
MENENIUS
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;And what is left, to lose it by his country,Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,A brand to the end o' the world.
SICINIUS
This is clean kam.
BRUTUS
Merely awry: when he did love his country,It honour'd him.
MENENIUS
                  The service of the footBeing once gangrened, is not then respectedFor what before it was.
BRUTUS
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:Lest his infection, being of catching nature,Spread further.
MENENIUS
One word more, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall findThe harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too lateTie leaden pounds to's heels.
Proceed by process;Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,And sack great Rome with Romans.
BRUTUS
If it were so,--SICINIUS
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
MENENIUS
Consider this: he has been bred i' the warsSince he could draw a sword, and is ill school'dIn bolted language; meal and bran togetherHe throws without distinction.
Give me leave,I'll go to him, and undertake to bring himWhere he shall answer, by a lawful form,In peace, to his utmost peril.
First Senator
Noble tribunes,It is the humane way: the other courseWill prove too bloody, and the end of itUnknown to the beginning.
SICINIUS
Noble Menenius,Be you then as the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons.
BRUTUS
Go not home.
SICINIUS
Meet on the market-place.
We'll attend you there:Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceedIn our first way.
MENENIUS
I'll bring him to you.
Let me desire your company: he must come,Or what is worst will follow.
First Senator
Pray you, let's to him.
