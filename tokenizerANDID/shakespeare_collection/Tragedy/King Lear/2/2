Before Gloucester's castle.
OSWALD
Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?
KENT
Ay.
OSWALD
Where may we set our horses?
KENT
I' the mire.
OSWALD
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
KENT
I love thee not.
OSWALD
Why, then, I care not for thee.
KENT
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make theecare for me.
OSWALD
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
KENT
Fellow, I know thee.
OSWALD
What dost thou know me for?
KENT
A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; abase, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; alily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be abawd, in way of good service, and art nothing butthe composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom Iwill beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniestthe least syllable of thy addition.
OSWALD
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to railon one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
KENT
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thouknowest me!
Is it two days ago since I tripped upthy heels, and beat thee before the king?
Draw, yourogue: for, though it be night, yet the moonshines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.
OSWALD
Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
KENT
Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against theking; and take vanity the puppet's part against theroyalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll socarbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.
OSWALD
Help, ho!
murder! help!KENT
Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neatslave, strike.
OSWALD
Help, ho!
murder! murder!EDMUND
How now!
What's the matter?KENT
With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'llflesh ye; come on, young master.
GLOUCESTER
Weapons!
arms! What 's the matter here?CORNWALL
Keep peace, upon your lives:He dies that strikes again.
What is the matter?REGAN
The messengers from our sister and the king.
CORNWALL
What is your difference? speak.
OSWALD
I am scarce in breath, my lord.
KENT
No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour.
Youcowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: atailor made thee.
CORNWALL
Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
KENT
Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter couldnot have made him so ill, though he had been but twohours at the trade.
CORNWALL
Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
OSWALD
This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have sparedat suit of his gray beard,--KENT
Thou whoreson zed!
thou unnecessary letter! Mylord, if you will give me leave, I will tread thisunbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall ofa jakes with him.
Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?CORNWALL
Peace, sirrah!
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
KENT
Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
CORNWALL
Why art thou angry?
KENT
That such a slave as this should wear a sword,Who wears no honesty.
Such smiling rogues as these,Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twainWhich are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passionThat in the natures of their lords rebel;Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaksWith every gale and vary of their masters,Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
CORNWALL
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
GLOUCESTER
How fell you out? say that.
KENT
No contraries hold more antipathyThan I and such a knave.
CORNWALL
Why dost thou call him a knave?
What's his offence?KENT
His countenance likes me not.
CORNWALL
No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
KENT
Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:I have seen better faces in my timeThan stands on any shoulder that I seeBefore me at this instant.
CORNWALL
This is some fellow,Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affectA saucy roughness, and constrains the garbQuite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainnessHarbour more craft and more corrupter endsThan twenty silly ducking observantsThat stretch their duties nicely.
KENT
Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,Under the allowance of your great aspect,Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fireOn flickering Phoebus' front,--CORNWALL
What mean'st by this?
KENT
To go out of my dialect, which youdiscommend so much.
I know, sir, I am noflatterer: he that beguiled you in a plainaccent was a plain knave; which for my partI will not be, though I should win your displeasureto entreat me to 't.
CORNWALL
What was the offence you gave him?
OSWALD
I never gave him any:It pleased the king his master very lateTo strike at me, upon his misconstruction;When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,And put upon him such a deal of man,That worthied him, got praises of the kingFor him attempting who was self-subdued;And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,Drew on me here again.
KENT
None of these rogues and cowardsBut Ajax is their fool.
CORNWALL
Fetch forth the stocks!
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,We'll teach you--KENT
                  Sir, I am too old to learn:Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;On whose employment I was sent to you:You shall do small respect, show too bold maliceAgainst the grace and person of my master,Stocking his messenger.
CORNWALL
Fetch forth the stocks!
As I have life and honour,There shall he sit till noon.
REGAN
Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.
KENT
Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,You should not use me so.
REGAN
Sir, being his knave, I will.
CORNWALL
This is a fellow of the self-same colourOur sister speaks of.
Come, bring away the stocks!GLOUCESTER
Let me beseech your grace not to do so:His fault is much, and the good king his masterWill cheque him for 't: your purposed low correctionIs such as basest and contemned'st wretchesFor pilferings and most common trespassesAre punish'd with: the king must take it ill,That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,Should have him thus restrain'd.
CORNWALL
I'll answer that.
REGAN
My sister may receive it much more worse,To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,For following her affairs.
Put in his legs.Come, my good lord, away.
GLOUCESTER
I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,Whose disposition, all the world well knows,Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.
KENT
Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:Give you good morrow!
GLOUCESTER
The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.
KENT
Good king, that must approve the common saw,Thou out of heaven's benediction comestTo the warm sun!
Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,That by thy comfortable beams I mayPeruse this letter!
Nothing almost sees miraclesBut misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,Who hath most fortunately been inform'dOf my obscured course; and shall find timeFrom this enormous state, seeking to giveLosses their remedies.
All weary and o'erwatch'd,Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to beholdThis shameful lodging.
Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!
