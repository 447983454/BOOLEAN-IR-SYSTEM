Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.
Doctor
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceiveno truth in your report.
When was it she last walked?Gentlewoman
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seenher rise from her bed, throw her night-gown uponher, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and againreturn to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
Doctor
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at oncethe benefit of sleep, and do the effects ofwatching!
In this slumbery agitation, besides herwalking and other actual performances, what, at anytime, have you heard her say?
Gentlewoman
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
Doctor
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
Gentlewoman
Neither to you nor any one; having no witness toconfirm my speech.
Lo you, here she comes!
This is her very guise;and, upon my life, fast asleep.
Observe her; stand close.Doctor
How came she by that light?
Gentlewoman
Why, it stood by her: she has light by hercontinually; 'tis her command.
Doctor
You see, her eyes are open.
Gentlewoman
Ay, but their sense is shut.
Doctor
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.
Gentlewoman
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thuswashing her hands: I have known her continue inthis a quarter of an hour.
LADY MACBETH
Yet here's a spot.
Doctor
Hark!
she speaks: I will set down what comes fromher, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
LADY MACBETH
Out, damned spot!
out, I say!--One: two: why,then, 'tis time to do't.
--Hell is murky!--Fie, mylord, fie!
a soldier, and afeard? What need wefear who knows it, when none can call our power toaccount?
--Yet who would have thought the old manto have had so much blood in him.
Doctor
Do you mark that?
LADY MACBETH
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?
--What, will these hands ne'er be clean?
--No more o'that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all withthis starting.
Doctor
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
Gentlewoman
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure ofthat: heaven knows what she has known.
LADY MACBETH
Here's the smell of the blood still: all theperfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this littlehand.
Oh, oh, oh!Doctor
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
Gentlewoman
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for thedignity of the whole body.
Doctor
Well, well, well,--Gentlewoman
Pray God it be, sir.
Doctor
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have knownthose which have walked in their sleep who have diedholily in their beds.
LADY MACBETH
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not sopale.
--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; hecannot come out on's grave.
Doctor
Even so?
LADY MACBETH
To bed, to bed!
there's knocking at the gate:come, come, come, come, give me your hand.
What'sdone cannot be undone.
--To bed, to bed, to bed!Doctor
Will she go now to bed?
Gentlewoman
Directly.
Doctor
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deedsDo breed unnatural troubles: infected mindsTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all!
Look after her;Remove from her the means of all annoyance,And still keep eyes upon her.
So, good night:My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.
Gentlewoman
Good night, good doctor.
