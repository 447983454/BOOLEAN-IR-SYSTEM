Country near Birnam wood.
MALCOLM
Cousins, I hope the days are near at handThat chambers will be safe.
MENTEITH
We doubt it nothing.
SIWARD
What wood is this before us?
MENTEITH
The wood of Birnam.
MALCOLM
Let every soldier hew him down a boughAnd bear't before him: thereby shall we shadowThe numbers of our host and make discoveryErr in report of us.
Soldiers
It shall be done.
SIWARD
We learn no other but the confident tyrantKeeps still in Dunsinane, and will endureOur setting down before 't.
MALCOLM
'Tis his main hope:For where there is advantage to be given,Both more and less have given him the revolt,And none serve with him but constrained thingsWhose hearts are absent too.
MACDUFF
Let our just censuresAttend the true event, and put we onIndustrious soldiership.
SIWARD
The time approachesThat will with due decision make us knowWhat we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:Towards which advance the war.
